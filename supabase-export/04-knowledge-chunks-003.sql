 PROCEDURE 
 TASK 1:   Finding Resonance frequency and circuit current 
1   Solder the components as shown Fig 1   to obtain a 
simple series resonance circuit. Connect instruments 
as shown in Fig 1. 
LED   may not   be glow or   may be very dim, 
because the   set frequency of1KHz may not be 
the resonance frequency of the circuit. 
Gradually   increase the frequency   and   record the 
resonance frequency f, at which the circuit current 
becomes maximum (LED glows brightly). 
This is the resonance frequency of the series 
resonance circuit because at series resonance, 
current   |   through   the   LC   circuit   will   be 
maximum.

 Compare and record the difference in the resonance 
frequency calculated in step 3 and that measured in 
step 5. 
Vary the input frequency in steps of 500 Hz around the 
resonance frequency and in each step record the value 
of circuit current in Table 1. 
Fromthe recorded readings of current instep 6, plota 
graph   of   frequency   versus   current   and   mark   the 
resonance frequency of the LC series circuit. (Fig 2)

 2   Setthe output ofthe signal generator to 3 volts, SOKHz, 
 sinewave. 
 3   Increase the frequency till the output of the trap circuit 
isminimum.   Recordthis frequency asthe trapfrequency 
and its the effect on the circuit. 
At   trap   frequency,   which   is   the   resonance 
frequency of the Shunt connected LC circuit, 
the impedance of the circuit will be minimum 
and hence the voltage across the circuit will be 
minimum.   Ideally,   this   should   be zero.   But, 
because of the internal resistance of the coil, 
the output voltage will not be zero but, will be 
minimum. 
4   Get your work checked by the instructor. 
LAB ASSIGNMENT: Change the value of the 
capacitor used in the LC circuit to 0.01pF and

 Switch   ON the 3-phase supply.   Measure the   line 
voltages by connecting the voltmeter leads between 
 two of the terminals   U,, V,, W.. 
 Measure the phase voltage by placing the voltmeter 
 leads across the lamps, i.e. U,, U,orV,,   V,or W,, W., 
4   Record the Line voltages and Phase voltages meas- 
ured, under the appropriate column in Table 2. 
Measure the Line and Phase currents and enter the 
readings in Table 2. 
An ammeter connected   between supply and 
load   indicates   Line   current.   An   ammeter 
connected in series with single load (twolamps 
in series) indicates Phase current. 
Repeat steps 2 to 5 for different loads. 
Switch   off the   supply   before   effecting   any 
change in the load. 
Verify the relationship between Line and Phase value of 
current and voltage. Enter in Table 3. 
 Result 
 In star

 Switch ‘ON’ the 3-phase supply and check whether the 
deflection of wattmeter is correct.   If both wattmeters 
deflect properly, goto step 4, otherwise continue from 
step 3. 
Switch ‘OFF’ the supply, if any one wattmeter deflects 
inthe reverse direction. Change the connection of the 
potential coil ofthe reverse deflectionwattmeter. Goto 
step 5.

 PROCEDURE 
 TASK 1: Grouping of cells in series connection 
4   
Check   the   individual cells for their condition. 
 *   Select 500 mA DC current range in mulimeter or 
500 mA DC ammeter. 
 «   Connect the cell across the meter in series with a 
3 ohm resistor. 
«   Watch the deflection. 
 Full deflection shows good condition of cell. 
Low deflection shows disharged condition of 
the cell. 
Cells having a higher internal resistance should 
not be used for series connection. 
Care should be taken for the cells polarity. 
Connect the cells as shown in Fig 1. 
Measure the voltage of one cell V,, twocells V,, three 
cells V, and four cells V, connected in series. 
Record   your observations   in the first and second 
columns of Table 1.

 PROCEDURE 
 TASK 1: Determine the number of cells required for a series group 
up the solar cells accordingly. 
A village panchayat office requires a light of 12V 3Watts for display purpose for four hours which has 
to be energized through a battery.   The battery is to be charged through an array of solar cells having 
125 mwicm’ capacity.   The light from sun expected to be available for   8 hours a day.   Calculate the 
number of solar cells in series group and the number of groups in parallel to charge the battery and wire 
1   Determine the number of solar cells in series group. 
Total required voltage

No. of cells in series group = 
Assuming charging voltage is 
equal to battery voltage + 1 volt   =12+17=13V

 PROCEDURE 
 TASK 1: Preparation of conduit pipe for cutting 
Assume the job needs a 300 mm long conduit 
drop but a standard length pipe of 3000 mm is 
only available.   Normally both the ends of a 
standard   length   pipe will   have threads.   To 
make the required conduit drop, the standard

 12 Apply the lubricant to the part to be threaded after the 
thread has been started. 
The lubricant allows the die to cool off the heat 
developed and thereby helps the edges to stay 
sharp and to produce   a   better thread finish. 
13 Make oneortwo complete turnsina clockwise direction. 
Check whether the stock is at right angle to the 
pipe axis. 
14 As indicated by the increased resistance of rotation, 
ease the handle as frequently as necessary, backin an 
anticlockwise direction for half a turn. 
Reverse turning is necessary to break off long 
cuttings and to clear the cutting edges of the 
die. 
15 Apply   the lubricant at frequent intervals.

by screwing on the female fittings (coupling etc.). 
The length of the thread should be sufficient to 
fit half way into the couplings and fully into the

 Make   an   allowance   in   cable   lengths   for 
terminations. 
Take   into   consideration   the   length   of 
accessories to be used in various places along 
with the conduit threads while taking conduit 
measurements. 
6   Cut the length of the conduit as per markings and 
remove the burrs. 
While marking on the conduit pipe for cutting, 
consider the   economical   way to   utilize the 
pipes without much wastage in the lengths. 
Cut threads   in the pipes and remove the burrs. 
Prepare the T.W. spacers with through holesfor fixing 
onthe |.P.C. and pilot holes to fix the saddles. 
9   Fix the T.W. spacers as per the layout. 
10 Fix the conduit pipe and conduitaccessories as per the 
layout by means of saddles. 
 12   Provide bushes inthe conduit ends. 
 13   Insert the given fish wire in the pipe run for drawing 
cables. 
Drawing of cables should   be done stage by 
stage,   taking   each   run   one   by   one,   and 
consolidating the   number of cables   in   each 
 run. 
 14 Skin the cables and mark each cable legibly at both 
ends. 
15 Groupthe cables as per cable route and cable runs and 
fasten them to the fish wire as shown in Fig 21. 
Check the continuity of cables before fastening 
the   cables to the fish wire. 
16 Pull the cables by means of the fish wire, and, at the
