increases withthe potential and attainavery highvelocity. 
The movement of electrons results in collision with the 
netural atoms, and may detach electrons fromthem. The 
high velocity of electrons   is   responsible for luminous

 Circuit description and operation 
Step-up transformer: The step uptransformer is usedto 
obtain a high voltage.   The centre tap is earthed.   The 
secondary output voltage is connected to the neon lamp. 
R.F. chokeLis connected inseries with the primary ofthe 
leakage transformer to limit the surge current of the neon 
lamp.   (Fig 4) 
The capacitor C Itis connected across the primary of the 
transformer to improve the powerfactor. 
The fireman switch   $2 It is connected alongwith the 
main switch and is used as an emergency switch. (Fig 4) 
 Sodium   vapour   lamp 
 Main switches normally 15A 250V ICDP are used to 
control the circuits. 
H.T. cables are used to connect the secondary of the 
transformer to the neon sign lamp as per IE rule No 71. 
Colour mechanism of neon sign lamp: When electric 
current   is conducted   by   a   gas   or vapour   it   produces 
luminous light. The elements most commonly used inthis 
process of producing light by gaseous discharge are neon 
or mercury.   The neon discharge yields orange-red light 
which is very popular in making   advertising signs.   The 
pressure of neon in the tubes is usually from 3 to 20 mm 
of the Hg. (millimeter of mercury) 
The ultimate colour produced by usingfluorescent powders 
depends   not only on the chemical composition of the 
powders but also onthe gas, the pressure at whichthe gas 
was filled, the diameter of the tubing and the operating 
current.

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the sodium vapour lamp and its types 
*   describe the construction of low and high pressure sodium vapour lamp 
*   state the functions of the parts in the circuit. 
Sodium vapour lamp and its types: Sodium   vapour 
lamp is acold cathode gas discharge   lamp, which gives 
a   yellow   colour   light. Sodium   lamps are   particularly 
suitable infogas their yellow light can penetrate fog better. 
The average life of a sodiumvapour lampis well over 6000 
hours.   There are two types of Sodium Vapour lamps as 
givenbelow: 
*   low pressure SV lamp 
*   high pressure SV lamp. 
 Construction 
 Low   pressure sodium vapour lamp: In   the   sodium 
vapour lampsefficiency decreases rapidly asthe   current 
density   is   increased   above   a   certain value. 
Consequently   the   lamp has   to   be operated at   a   low 
current   density   and   thisnecessitatesa large   surface 
area of the tube. 
This lamp possesses   a   brightness   of   7.5   candle   per 
sq.cm. Because ofthese points the length of this tube has 
to be very long.

 LEAK TRANSFORMER  ELN248635 
 The primary andthe secondary windings are connected 
inseries and placed around the centre   limb of a 3-core 
yoke.   Between the coils, a loose iron core is clamped in 
the yoke   oneither   side, which acts   as   a shunt for the 
magnetic field. 
Under no-loadconditions, the resistance of the shunt is 
large due to air gaps, with the result the magnetic field 
moves through the limbs of the yoke, andthe device acts 
as an auto-transformer.   But when the lamp ignites and 
consumes current, a part   of   the   magnetic   field leaks 
away   through the shunt due te the counter-acting field of 
the secondary. 
The device now actsasa chokecoil reducing the voltage 
across the lamp electrodes to the required value. 
 High   pressure mercury vapour lamp (H.P.M.V) 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the principle of discharge lamps 
*   describe the working of a high pressure’ mercury   vapour lamp 
*   explain the different types of mercury vapour lamps. 
All   modern discharge   lamps   operate   in a translucent 
enclosure. The initial discharge is usually struck in argon 
 orneon. 
 The discharge occurs in an inner tube enclosed in an outer 
evacuated tube. (Fig 1) The inner tube of glass or quartz 
contains mercury and a small amount of argonto assist in 
the starting of the discharge. The electrodes are rich in 
electron-emittting materials in order to permit ease in the 
release ofelectrons.

 HPMV lamps 
The lamp operates at high pressure. To start the discharge, 
an auxiliary electrode is positioned quite close to the main 
electrode. The auxiliary electrode is connected to the lamp 
terminal through a high resistor. 
The high resistor limits the current. When switched on, the 
normal mains voltage   is not sufficient to start the discharge 
between the main electrodes but it can start over the very 
short distance between the mainand auxiliary electrodes. 
At the beginning, the discharge current passing through 
the high resistance causes a potential differenceto   develop 
betweenthe starting electrode and one of the mainelectrode 
through the argon gas. The discharge now spreads rapidly 
until it takes place between the main electrodes. 
The argondischarge then warms upthe tube and vaporises 
the   mercury.   Soon the gas content is mainly mercury 
vapour and   the   argon   has   less   and   less   effect.   The 
discharge then takes place in the mercury vapour. 
Types of HPMV lamps 
Three different types of high pressure mercury vapour 
lamps are: 
«   MA type (MV lamp with auxiliary electrode) 
*   MAT type (MV lamp with tungsten filament)

MA type HPMV lamp: The discharge tube is made of 
borosilicate whichis quite hard. The tube consisting ofthe 
main and auxiliary electrodes is sealed with an inside 
pressure of one anda   half atmospheres. The lamp hasa 
screw cap and is connected to the mains through the 
choke. (Fig 2) The lamp takes about 5 minutes to start 
giving full output. 
This lamp, once switched off, will not restartagain untilthe 
pressure developed inside the tube falls back.   It takes 
about 7 minutes to start again. There is no harminkeeping 
the switchon. The lamp should always be hung vertically, 
otherwise the inner tube   will be damaged. 
The efficiency is 45 Im/watt for 400 watts lamp

 Objectives : At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the principle of discharge lamps 
*   describe the construction of single tube fluorescent lamp with its components 
¢   state the function of each component in the circuit. 
Principle of a discharge lamp:   The basic principle of a 
gas-discharge   lamp is explained   in Fig   1.   Gases are 
normally poor conductors, especially at atmospheric and 
higher pressures, but application ofsuitable voltage (known 
as ignition voltage) between two electrodes ina sealed 
envelope containing gas at low pressure ionises the gas, 
and current passes from one electrode to the otherthrough 
the gas medium.

 A glass   shell   with   two electrodes   apart   is   connected 
through lead in wires to the voltage source. The space 
within the shell is filled with low pressure vapour. Whenthe 
voltage applied to the electrodes is increased to a certain 
value, the gas inside gets ionised and starts conducting. 
Construction of fluorescent tubes: A   fluorescent light 
bulbis basically a glass tube capped by two bases. (Fig 2) 
These bases are fitted with pins to carry current to internal 
components called cathodes. Contained inside the tube 
are minute droplets of mercury and an inert gas. 
The inner surface of the tube is coated with a fluorescent 
powder or phoshpher. This phosphor emits light when 
exposed to ultra-violet rays. Cathodes or electrodes are 
made upof coiled tungsten filaments coated with a mixture 
of barium and strontium oxides.

 Function of the various parts ina fluorescent light circuit 
Ballast (Choke): The ballast is basically a coil of many 
turns wound ona laminated ironcore (Fig 4). Itsteps up the 
supply voltage to start the fluorescent tube   conducting. 
Once the tube is conducting, it regulates the flow of heavy 
current to the tube cathodes to keepthem from burning out.

 Starters: Astarter inthe fluorescent tube circuit performs 
two functions. 
*   It   completes the   circuit   at   first for   preheating   the 
electrodes. 
¢   ltopens the circuit to provide voltage kick for ignition. 
There are two types of starters. 
*   Glow-type 
*   Thermaltype 
Glowtype starters: A glow-type starter switch (Fig5) isthe 
one most widely used. It consists of a gas-filled glass tube 
containing two electrodes, one of which isa bimetallic strip. 
When voltage is applied to the starter, a glow discharge 
occurs betweenthe two contacts. The heat thus developed 
causes the bimetallic strip to deflect and close the circuit. 
Current for preheating the electrodes starts flowing. Atthe 
same time the glow discharge ceases resulting In the 
cooling ofthe bimetallic strip. The contacts reopen andthe 
voltage induced in the choke coil provides the ignition 
voltage. 
Thermal type starter: The starter has a bimetalic strip 
close to the resistance R which produces heat. 
Thermal type starters are generally enclosed ina hydrogen 
 -filled glass bulb G. The two switch electrodes   E, andE, 
 are normally closed whenthe lamp is notinoperation. When 
normal supply is switched on, the lamp filament electrodes 
Aand Bare connected together throughthe thermal switch 
and a large current passes through them.

 Consequently,   they   are   heated   to   incandescence. 
Meanwhile the heat produced in resistance R causes the 
bimetallic strip E, to break contact. The inductive surge of 
 about 1000V produced by the choke is sufficient to start 
 discharge through mercury vapours as explained. The heat 
produced in R keeps the swtich contacts E, and E, open 
during the time as shown in Fig 6. 
A 0.006   MFD capacitor (C,)   is connected across the 
electrodes of the starter contacts (bimetals) inthe case of 
boththermal and glow type starters, to eliminate any radio 
interference effects that may be caused by the opening and 
closing of the bimetallic contacts.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain Halogen lamp construction 
*   describe the principle of tangsten halogen regenerative cycle process 
Construction: Halogen lamps are the most advanced and 
multi-purpose incandescent lamps. Although they belong 
to the incandescent family of lamps, they are designed to 
provide a superior quality of crisp white light, long life, high 
efficiency and constant lumen maintenance. Due to their 
reduced   size,   the   halogen   lamps allow for the   most 
compact and stylish fixture   designs.   Halogen   lamps 
operate on the tungsten halogen regenerative principle 
which eliminates filament evaporation and bulb blackening. 
Asa result, the initial lumens and color temperature are 
maintained throughout the lamp life. The use of bromine, 
which is a transparent gas, increases efficiency by 28 -33 
jumens/watt as compared with iodine because there is 
less absorption of light by the filled gas (Fig 1). 
Principle of tungsten   halogen   regenerative cycle 
 process 
 1   Ifthe lamp is turned on, tungsten particles evaporate 
from filament and attach on to bulb wall. At the same 
time,   halogen is decomposed and becomes atomic 
halogen. 
2   Atomic   halogen   is diffused   on the   bulb wall   and 
combines with free tungsten   particle to   become 
transparent and volatile tungsten halide. 
3   Due tothe high temperature (over 500°F) on the bulb

 The halogen lamp''s envelope is made of quartz glass   “pul 
because of the high operating temperature and pressure 
 required to permit the halogen regenerative cycle   process.   sme   Molybdenum Fou, 
 Quartz also renders the lamp extremely resistant to heat 
impact. The small dimensions of halogen   jamps 
allow accurate control over the light beam for a better 
focused and precise light. 
 Tungsten Halogen Lamp 
Halogen is the name given to group of gaseous elements 
like   flourine,   chlorine,   bromine   and   lodine.In 
 incandescent lamp the life of filament is affected by 
evaporation of tungsten. 
To prevent this a small ammount of halogen gas (say iodine) 
is added to the argon gas filling of the lamp. Evaporated 
tungsten iodine is very volatile and suffers thermal diffusion 
in direction of filament and gets decomposed into tungsten 
 and halogen. 
Tungsten so   relesed is deposited   back on filament 
 restoring its strength. Thus addition of halogen results in 
formation of a regenerative cycle and evaporation of 
tungsten is prevented.   This also results in increased 
efficiency as tungsten filament can now be heated to much 
more ternperature (Fig 2). 
 To maintain this regenerative cycle, it is necessary that 
 the wall temperature is maintained high to 2500°C. The 
lamp envelope is therefore made of quartz due to which it 
is possible to miniaturise, as filling gas can now be filled 
 at high gas pressure.

 The efficacy  of this lamp is 50% more as compared to 
GLS for equal watage  and life is just double. These lamps 
 have better colour rendition. These are available in sizes 
 of 500 Wto S5kW. Halogen  lamp with much better  efficiency 
and lesser sizes  but having  very less life are manufactured 
for TV photography and film camera purpose. 
 The Fig 3 shows the different shapes of halogen lamps.

CFL Lamp 
Construction:   A compact fluorescent lamp (CFL), also 
called compact fluorescent light, energy-saving light, and 
compact fluorescent tube, is a fluorescent lamp designed 
to replace an incandescent lamp; sometypes fit into light 
fixtures formerly used for incandescent lamps. The lamps 
use a tube which is curved or folded to fit into the space of 
an incandescent bulb, anda compact electronic ballast in 
the base of the lamp (Fig 1) 
 Fig 1 
 ——  Fig 2.3.12.01 
 A CFL hasa   higher purchase price than an incandescent 
lamp, but can save over five times its purchase price in 
electricity costs over the lamp''s lifetime. 
Working principle : The principle of operation ina CFL 
bulb remains the same as in other fluorescent lighting: 
electrons that are bound to mercury atoms are excited to 
states where they will raciate ultraviolet light as they return 
to a lower energy level: this emitted ultraviolet light is 
 Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) 
 converted into visible light as it strikes the fluorescent 
coating on the bulb (as well as into heat when absorbed 
by other materials such as glass). 
CFLs radiate a spectral power distribution that is different 
from that of incandescent   lamps.   Improved   phosphor 
formulations have improved the perceived color of the light 
emitted by CFLs, such that some sources rate the best 
"soft white" CFLs as subjectively similar in color to standard 
incandescent lamps. 
Types of CFL 
There are two types of CFLs: 
1   Integrated   lamps 
2   Non-integrated lamps. 
Integrated   lamps: Integrated lamps combine the tube 
and ballast ina single unit. These lamps allow consumers 
to replace incandescent lamps easily with CFLs. Integrated 
CFLs work well   in   many standard   incandescent light 
fixtures, reducing the cost of converting to fluorescent. 
Non-integrated lamps: Non-integrated CFLs have the 
ballast permanently installed in the luminaire, and only 
the lamp bulb is usually changed at its end of life. Since 
the ballasts are placed in the light fixture, they are larger 
and last longer compared to the integrated ones, and they 
don''t need to be replaced when the bulb reaches its end- 
of-life. Non-integrated CFL housings can be both more 
expensive and sophisticated. 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
 *   state the advantages of LEDs over-conventional bulbs 
* explain the principle of working of LED 
¢ State the popular types of LED. 
Light emitting diodes (LED) 
One ofthe most commonand popular of new devices inthe 
optical electronics is the Light Emitting Diode abbreviated 
as LED. These LEDs are now used as indicators inalmost 
all electrical and electronic circuits and equipments. 
The advantages of LEDs over incandescent bulbs are 
listed below: 
1   LEDs have no filaments to heat and so require less 
current to glow. 
2   LEDsrequire lower voltage level (typically   1.2to2.5V} 
than the conventional bulbs. 
LEDs last much longer - upto several years. 
Because there is no filament to heat up,   LEDs are 
always cool. 
5   LEDs can be switched ON and OFF at a much faster 
rate compared with conventional lamps. 
Principle of working of LEDs 
Although LED is also a type ofdiode, it cannotand should 
not be used for the purpose of rectifying AC to DC.ALED 
is   asemi conductor device which emits visible ligt   when   it 
is property connected with the electric supply. 
Recall that   a general purpose diode or a rectifier diode 
conducts when energy is suppliedto the electrons (Si=0.7V, 
Ge=0.3V) to cross the barrierjunction. Each electron, after 
acquiring the supplied extra energy, crosses the junction 
and falls into the hole onthe P side of the junction while the 
electron recombines with a hole, the electron gives up the

form of heat and light.

LEDs are typically doped with gallium arsenic,   gallium 
phosphate orgallium arseno-phosphate. Different   dopes 
cause the LEDto emit lightofdifferentcolours   (wave- 
lengths)   such   as   red,   yellow,   green,   amber,   or   even 
invisible infrared light. 
The schematic symbol of LED Non-integrated lamps is as 
shown in   (Fig 1b). The arrows are used to indicate that light 
is radiated from the device.

 Types of LEDs 
 Single colour LEDs: Most of the commercially available 
 andcommonly used LEDs are single colour LEDs. These 
LEDs radiate one ofthe colours such as red, green, yellow 
or orange.   Different coloured LEDs will have different 
forward voltages as given inthe table below: 
Colour of LED   Red   | Orange | Yellow | Green 
Typical Forward 
voltage drop   1.8V   2V   21V)   2.2V 
 High   pressure metal   halide lamps 
 These typical forward voltage drops are at a 
typical LED forward current I, = 20 mA. 
Two   colour LEDs: These LEDs can give two colours. 
Actually, these are tvo LEDs put ina single package and 
connected   . (Fig 2) 
In atwo-colour LED, two LEDs are connected in inverse 
parallel, so that one of the colour is emitted whenthe LED 
is biased in one direction and the other colour is emitted 
whenthe LEDis biasedinthe other direction. These LEDs 
are more expensive than the single colour LEDs. These 
LEDs are usefulto indicate +ve, -ve polarities, GO-NOGO 
indication, null detection etc.

 Multicolour LEDs: These are special types of LEDs which 
canemit more thantwo colours. These LEDs comprises of

This LED will emit green or red colour by turning ON only 
one LED atatime. This LED will   emit orange oryellow by 
turning on the two LEDs with different current ratios as 
shown inthe table givenabove. 
Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   describe the working principle of metal halide lamp (M.H.L) 
*   explain the starting of M.H lamp 
*   state the parts of MH lamp and its starting methods. 
Metal halide lamps 
This type of lamp is also known as an “MH'' lamp. It is an 
HID lamp (High intensity Discharge}, which means it pro- 
vides most of its light from the electric arc within a small 
discharge tube. It is becoming increasingly popular due 
to its good quality white light and good efficiency. The 
most prominent use of the MH lamp is in stadiums and

 When the lamp is cold the halides and mercury are con- 
densed onthe fused quartz tube. VVhen the lampis turned 
on current passed through the starting electrode and jumps 
the short distance to the main electrode (Fig 1), this is 
aided by argon gas. The argon strikes an arc at low tem- 
peratures. 
After the initial small arc the tube heats up and the mer- 
cury is vaporized. Electric arcs fight to works through the 
distance of a gas, but over time more molecules of the 
gas become ionized. This makes it even easier for more 
electric current to pass through, so the arc gets wider and 
hotter. 
In the lamp as the first arc heats up, it begins to turn the 
solid mercury into a vapor, scon the arc is able to travel 
through the mercury vapor to reach the other main electrode 
on the opposite sicle of the discharge tube. There is less 
resistance on this path now and current stops flowing 
through the starting electrode, just as a river changes 
course to a path of least resistance, drying out the previ- 
 ous channel. 
 Parts of Metal Halide lamps. 
Fig.2 shows the inner parts and its various function of a 
metal halide lamp. The inner tube contains the electrodes 
and various metal halides, along with mercury and inert 
gases that make up the mix. The typical halides used are 
some combination of Sodium, Thallium, and Scandium 
and Dysprosium lodides. These iodides control the lamp''s 
spectral power distribution and provide color balance by 
combining the spectra of the various iocides used. 
Light is generated by creating an arc between the two 
electrodes located inside the inner arc tube. The inner arc 
tube is typically made of quartz, and this is a very harsh 
environment, with high temperatures approaching 1000°C 
and pressure of 3 or 4 atmospheres. 
To start a metal halide lamp, a high starting voltage is 
applied to the lamp''s electrodes to ionize the gas before

Starting Metal Halide Lamps 
Ametal halice lamp''s starting requirements are important 
because they impact the type of ballast that the lamp 
requires. Two methods are used to start MH lamps: probe 
start (standard start) and pulse start. 
Probe start refers to the method used to ignite the arc in 
the tube. Atraditional or probe start metal halide lamp has 
three electrodes - two for maintaining the arc and a third 
internal starting electrode, or probe. 
Ahigh open circuit voltage from the ballast initiates an arc 
between the starting electrode and the operating electrode 
at one end of the arc tube. Once the lamp reaches full 
output, a bi-metallic switch closes to short out the probe, 
thereby discontinuing the starting arc. 
Pulse-start   MH lamps do not have a starting probe elec- 
trode. An igniter in the pulse start system delivers a high 
voltage pulse (typically 3 to 5 kilovalts) directly across the 
lamp''s operating electrodes to start the lamp, eliminating 
the probe and bi-metallic switch needed in probe start 
lamps. 
Without the probe electrode, the amount of pinch (or seal) 
area atthe end of the arc tube is reduced, which allows for 
increased full pressure and reduced heat loss. Further- 
more,   using an   ignitor with a   lamp reduces tungsten 
sputtering by heating   up the   electrodes faster during 
starting, reducing the lamp''s warm-up time.

Lighting   for decoration - Serial set design - Flasher 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
 ¢   state the methods used for decoration 
«   state the names of flasher and their function. 
 Use of decoration lights 
Electric   lignt   decoration   for   special   occasions   like 
wedding parties, festivals and fairs is   a common feature 
nowadays.   Special electric light sign circuits add much 
colour, fun and pleasure on the occasion.   Electric signs, 
particularly   neon   signs,   are   extensively   used   in 
advertisements which   have tremendous eye catching 
effects.   Decoration   with   electric   signs   improves   the 
appearance   of a   building   and   makes the   place   more 
 attractive. 
 Two methods are mainly used for decoration. 
*   Signs employing miniature low voltage incandescent 
lights which can be switched on and off in sequence to 
produce the desired effect. 
*   Neonsignsemployingtubes shapedto produce designs 
in various colours, the colour being determined by the 
type of gas used in the tube. 
Miniature incandescentlamps: Miniature   incandescent 
lamps are normally available with 6V,   9V,   12V & 16V 
ratings with different colours which may be grouped in 
series or series   parallel   combinations for operation in 
available 240V supply. 
For getting different messages and decoration effects the 
following types of flasher signs are used. 
Speller type flashers are used for spelling out signs letter 
by letter or word by word for building up or down, plain on- 
offflashing, with changing colour. 
Speed type flashers are used for operating spectacular 
signs such as lighting waving-flags,   - flame,   revolving 
wheels etc. 
Scripttype flashers asthe name implies are usedwhen the 
effect of handwriting in script letters is desired. 
Anexample of a speed type flasher for revolving is shown 
in Fig 1. The speed of running light/ rotating light can be 
adjusted. Inthis three-point running light (the sign flasher) 
there are three groups of lamps, each group switched on 
andoff, insequence, for running effect (Fig 2) withthe help 
ofasmall induction motorwhichis running on eddy current 
principle and is connected to 240V/115V 50 Hz.   Cans or 
drums are mounted on a shaft which is rotated by the 
moter.

 The circumference of the cans or the drums are so cutthat 
the brushes will make contact only during the fixed portion 
ofthe revolution, thus completing the circuit. We canmake 
three independent circuits by the 3-point sign flashers 
which are switched ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ successively. 
 Designing a decorative serial lamp for a given supply voltage 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   calculate the number of bulbs to be connected in series for   a given supply voltage. 
Serial set design 
We have to designarow of   6or9 volts lamps.   Ifthese 
lamps are connected directly to the 240V supply, the 
lamps will   get fusedimmediately. Therefore the lamps 
are   to   be   connected   in   series.   The   calculation   as 
shown will be - 
1   For 6 volts lamps

 Precautions 
*   Neverconnectthe low volt lamps directly tothe mains. 
¢«   Never touch the exposed wires. 
In the above case we discussed for 6V and 9V lamps.   In 
the market we get for 6 volts different current ratings viz. 
100mA, 150mA, 300mA, 500mA.   The shape of the lamp 
forthe above current ratings however remains the same. 
For the series lamps to work satisfactorily the current 
rating of all the lamps should be the same. 
Ve can prepare serial lamps with different voltages but of 
the same current rating. 
Example 
You have 25 lamps of 6V, 300mA rating and 20 numbers 
of 9V,300mA lamps.   How will you design a ‘serial lamp’ 
 circuit for 240V supply mains 
 a   using all the available 6V lamps and for the rest of 9V 
lamps. 
b   using all the available 9V lamps and for the remaining 
6V lamps. 
Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the purpose of the flasher in the series lamp circuit. 
Flasher: In the row of lamps of low voltage, a small lamp 
(flasher) of filament type is connected in series with the 
otherlamps. Thislamp (flasher) does not give light but acts 
as a switch for the other lamps. This lamp contains a 
bimetal   strip,   which   is   in   contact   with   a   fixed   strip 
 (Fig 1).

 Vvhen the row of lamps is connected across the supply and 
switched ON, the bimetal strip gets heated up, this breaks 
the contacts and disconnects supply to the other lamps, 
making the lamps OFF. 
After a few seconds, the bimetal strip cools down and 
makes contact.   The supply to the other lamps is ON and 
the lamps light up.   This is a twinkling type row of lamps 
used for decoration (Fig 2). 
The rating of the flasher in each row of (small) low voltage 
lamps must be the same as that of the other lamps inthat 
series circuit. Ifthe lamps are ofdifferent ratings, thenthe 
flasher should be of the lowest current capacity in that 
circuit.

 Though the flasher can be connected anywhere in the 
series circuit, itshould be connected   atthe supply (pnase} 
considering it as a switch. 
The operating condition of the flasher can be decided by 
observation. Ifthe bimetal strip is found welded to a fixed 
strip,   then the flasher   is   not   useful   and   if it   is   in   an 
unserviceable condition.   It   can   also   be found   out   by 
connecting   in   circuit   and   tested for   its   condition,   Le. 
whether itis operating or not. 
Yvhen a number of series lamp rows are connected in

Show case lights and fittings - calculation of lumens efficiency 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
¢   state the types of bulbs for illumination 
¢   explain direct and indirect lighting and showcase lighting 
¢   explain the luminuous efficiency calculation. 
Show   case   lighting:   A   number   of   commercial 
establishments use visual representation to their products, 
using a lighting system called show case lights. Some of 
them are discussed below. 
Counters and dealing shelves: |nbank cages and ticket 
offices supplementary trough lighting equipmentis   usually 
located at the top of the cages to produce a band of light 
lengthwise onthe counter. Troughs may be covered with 
diffusing glass or fitted with longitudinal louvers to shield 
the lamps.   Sixty watt lamps on 15 to 18 inch centres will 
generally be adequate. (Fig 1}

 Small metal bracket type reflectors luminary or reqular 25 
or 40.watt tubular lamps   effectively illuminate small   vertical 
display racks, stands and cabinets. (Fig 2}

 ELN249112 
 Small compact lens posts available in both 250 and 400 
watt size, mounted on columns or ceiling brackets, give 
sales   emphasis   to   small   counter   or   table   displays. 
Adjustable in spot size for   12 to 48 inches diameter spot 
at 10 ft. a 250 watt unit at 10 ft. will deliver 200 to 250 feet 
candles, witha 12to15 inches spot size: the 400 watt unit 
will give 350 to 400 foot candles.   (Fig 3) 
Forextencded vertical surface displays - rungs, tapestries, 
draperies, paintings - a series of 150 or 200 wattlens plate 
units at the ceiling is suitable for fixed display locations. 
Bracket type parabolic, polished metal troughs produce 
equivalent results and have some advantage in greater 
mobility. (Fig 4)

 Fornecessity and impulse items such as groceries, where 
attention rather than critical seeing is the   requirement, 
less engineering refinement is needed in shelf lighting 
equipment.   Concentrating   trough   reflectors   which 
incorporate luminous panels for changeable advertising 
 copy are satisfactory. Sockets 30 cms apart may be fitted 
 with 40 to 100 watt lamps, as conditions dictate. (Fig 5) 
 Fig 5 
 ELN248117 
 For lighting displays on celumns or built-in shelving a metal 
 nosing along the front edge of each shelf effectively 
conceals small 25 watt tubular lamps as shown in the 
 sketch.   Lamps should be spaced not more than 30 cms

 There are varieties of goods which are being displayed in 
showcasesof   different colours, size, shape, fineness etc. 
Hence Different shades and colour layers will be used to 
get the proper colour of goods orfineness of detail or both 
by proper illumination. 
Precaution should be taken while putting the merchandise 
inshowcases so that wiring will not be damaged. Also the 
wiring and merchandise should not get damaged due to the 
excessive heat of lamps. 
Luminous Efficiency Calculation 
Luminous Efficiency: Luminous efficiency is   ameasure 
of how will a light source produces a visible light.   It is a 
quantity of measurement for light source and it is defined 
as the   ratio of luminous flux to power of the lamp in watts. 
It''s unit is lumenfwatt in SI unit. 
 ee   Luminous flux in lumen 
Luminous efficiency = 
 Power in watt 
 Thisisimportant, itdescribes how muchlight is being given 
compare to the amount of electricity is used. 
Purpose of calculating luminous efficiency 
Typical house hold spends 30% of the electricity bill in 
lighting. Money can be saved by bringing the most cost 
efficient lighting option in home needs. 
For example   : A 6Qw light bulb Usually produces 860 
lumens. Calculate the luminous efficiency.

Electrical Measuring Instrument 
Electrical measuring instruments (meters) is an apparatus, 
used for measuring the electrical quantities like current, 
voltage, resistance power and energy etc. 
 Identification of instrument 
 The instrument should be identified for the quantity to be 
measured, the range, suitability for a particular type of 
supply etc. by carefully going through the data available on 
the dial. 
Types of current:   The types of supply oan which the 
instrument is suitable for measurement is indicated by 
symbols as follows. 
 —   Direct current 
 N   Alternating current 
~S   Direct and alternating current 
Testing potential (voltage): Tne star mark on the dial 
indicates the voltage to which the instrumentis subjected 
for test. 
 WW   
Testing potential 500V 
Testing potential over 500V eg, 2000V(2KV) 
 §27 
 Using position:   Instruments must be used as per the 
specified position mentioned on the dial. 
Vertical using position. 
r]   Horizontal using position. 
60°   Angle of usage eg. 60° tilt angle. 
Instruments used in any position other than the 
one specified may cause error in reading.

()   Moving coilinstrumentwith rectifier 
 pt 
 Indication error: Instruments are manufactured to read 
within certain accuracy. This is indicated on the dial by a 
number close to the other symbols. 
|   Indication error   £1% 
25   Indication error   2.5% 
 oie)   Indication error   3.5% 
 Terminal markings: Ina moving coil type of instrument, 
the terminals are marked with + and— . The positive (+) 
terminal is red in colour and the negative(-)   terminal   is 
black   in colour (Fig 1}.   This type of instrument must be 
connected inthe circuit with correct polarity. i.e. the +ve of 
 supply tothe +ve of instrumentandthe-ve of supply tothe 
 -ve of the instrument. 
Inthe moving irontype there is no polarity marking onthe 
terminals. Both the terminals are of the same colour. The 
instrument canbe connected inthe circuitwithout identifying 
the line and neutral of the supply.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
 +   classify dectrical instrum ents with respectto standard, function and operation by theeffectofelectric current 
+   explain the pe of forces required for the proper functioning of an electrical indicating instrument. 
Electrical instruments   tay be classified based   on the 
following. 
 »   hdanufacturing standarcs 
*   Function 
»   Effects of electric current on the instruments. 
 Manufacturing standards:   The electrical instruments 
tay, in a   broad   sense, be classified according to the 
manufacturing standards into absolute instruments and 
secondary instruments. 
 Absolute instruments: These instruments give the value 
of quantity to be measured   in terms of deflection and 
instrument constants.   A good exarnple of an absolute 
instrument is the tangent galvanometer (Fig 1). 
 Fig 1 
 These instruments are used only in standardlaboratories. 
 Secondary instruments: In these instruments the value 
of electrical quantity (voltage,   current, power, etc) to oe 
Measured can be determined from the deflection of the 
instruments on the   caliorated dial. These instruments 
shouldbe calibratedin compansionwith either an absolute 
iINstTTument orwith onewhichhas already been caliberated. 
All the instruments   used commercially   are secondary 
instruments. 
 Functions 
 secondary instruments arefurther classified   according 
to their   functions, that is, whether the   instrument 
indicates, orrecords the quantity to be measured. 
Accordingly,   we   have   indicating,   integrating   and 
recording   instruments. 
 Indicating instruments:   These   instruments   (Figs   2) 
indicate the value ofvoltage, current power   etc, directly on 
4 Graduated dial. Armeters, voltmeters and wattmeters 
belong to this class. 
 Integrating instruments: These instruments measure 
the total arnount,   either the quantity of electricity or the 
electrical energy, suppliedtoa circuit overa period oftime. 
Ampere hour meters and energy meters belong to this 
class. Fig 3 show''s the Kilowatt hourfenergy meter. 
 Fig 2 
 Fig 3 
 Recordinginstruments: These instruments registerthe 
quantity to be measured in agiventine, and are provided 
with   a pen which moves over a graph paper. Vvith this 
instrument, the quantity can be checkedtor any particular 
date andtimne.   Recording voltmeters ammeters and power 
factor meters belong to this class. Fig 4 shows such a 
recording instrurn ent.

 Effects   of   electric   current used   on   electrical

The effects utilised 
are as follows. 
*   Magneticeffect 
*   Heating effect 
*   Chemicaleffect 
*   Electrostatic effect 
*   Electromagnetic induction effect 
Essential forces required for an indicating instrument: 
The following three forces are essential requirements ofan 
indicating instrument for its satisfactory operation. They 
 are 
 *   deflecting force 
*   controlling force 
*   dampingforce. 
Deflecting force or operating force: This causes the 
moving system of the instrument to move from Its “zero’ 
position, when the instrument is connected to the supply. 
To obtain this force in an instrument, different effects of 
electric current, such as magnetic effect, heating effect, 
chemical effect etc. are employed. 
Controlling force: This force is essential to control the 
movement of the moving system and to ensure that the 
magnitude of the defiction ofthe pointer is always the same 
for a given value of the quantity to be measured. As such, 
the controlling force always acts opposite to the deflecting 
force, andalso brings the pointer to zero position when the 
instrument is disconnected from the supply. 
The controlling force could be produced by any one of the 
following ways. 
*   Gravity control 
*   Springcontrol 
Gravity control: In this method, small adjustable weights 
are attached to the opposite   extension of the   pointer 
(Fig   5).   These   weights   are   attracted   by   the   earth''s 
gravitational   pull,   and   thereby,   produce   the   required 
controlling force (torque). The instruments with gravity control 
are to be used in the vertical position only. 
When the instrument is not connected to the supply, the 
control weight and the balance weight attached to the 
opposite end of the pointer make the pointer to be at zero 
position (Fig 5). When the instrument is connected to the 
supply, the pointer moves ina clockwise direction, thereby 
displacing the weights (Fig 5).   Dueto the gravitational pull, 
the weights will try to come to their original vertical position, 
thereby exerting acontrolling force onthe movement ofthe 
moving system. 
Spring control: Tne most commonarrangement of spring 
control utilises two phosphor-bronze or beryllium-copper 
spiral hair-springs A and B, the inner ends of which are 
attached to the spindle S (FigS). The outer end of the spring 
Bisfixed, whereasthat of   Ais attached to the endofa lever

easily effected when needed.

 The two springs A and B are wound in opposite directions 
so that   whenthe moving system is deflected, one spring 
 winds up whilethe other unwinds, andthe controlling force 
 is due to the combined torsions of the springs. 
These springs are made from such alloys that they have: 
*   non-magnetic properties (should not get affected by 
external magnetism) 
*   low temperature cofficient (do not elongate due   to 
temperature) 
*   lowspecific resistance (can be used forleading current 
‘in’ and “out of the moving system). 
Spring controlled instruments have the followingadvantages 
over the gravity controlledinstruments. 
They are: 
*   the instruments can be used in any position

inertia of the moving system and the controlling force

resulting in   a waste oftime in taking the reading. 
The two methods of damping, commonly employed are: 
*   eddy currentdamping 
*   air frictiondamping. 
Eddy current damping: Fig 7 shows one form of eddy 
current   damping.   A   copper   or   aluminium   disc   D,is 
attached tothe spindle ''S''. When the pointer moves, the 
disc also moves. 
The disc is made to move inthe air gap betweenthe poles 
 of a permanent magnet M. The moving disc cuts the flux, 
 thereby inducing eddy currents   inthe disc. According to 
Lenz''slaw, the flux produced by the eddy current opposes 
the movement of the disc, thereby effecting the damping 
force.

 Inthe case of moving coil instruments, the moving coil is 
wound on   a thin aluminium former. The eddy currents 
induced inthe former produces the damping force. 
Airfriction damping: Fig8 shows the method of obtaining 
alr friction damping. Accordingly   a   thin metal vane   Vis 
attached to the spindle S, andthe vane is made to move 
inside a sector shaped box ‘e’ while the pointer moves on

 Alternatively, the vane   in the form of a piston could be 
arranged to move inside anair chamber (cylinder) as shown 
in Fig 9.   In the above two cases, the air inside the air 
chamber opposes the movement of the vane/piston, and, 
thereby, the damping force is created.

Permanent magnet moving coil (PMMC) instruments 
The most commonly used instrument to measure DC 
quantities   like voltage   and   current,   is   the   permanent 
magnet moving coil (PMMC) instrument. 
Principle: The working of the PMMC instrumentis based 
onthe principle that whena current-carrying conductor is 
placedina magneticfield, itisacted upon by aforce which

The aluminium former not only supports the coil, but also 
produces eddy currentfor damping. The coil andthe former

 The two ends of the coil are connected to two phosphor- 
bronze springs, fixed one on each spindle to lead in and 
lead out the current.   The springs are spiralled   in the 
opposite direction   in   order to   neutralize the effect of 
 temperature changes. 
 The horseshoe shaped permanent magnet is made of an 
alloy called ‘Alnico’ and ithas soft iron pole pieces which 
are shaped to   distribute   uniform flux in the air gap. 
A soft iron core is fixed in such a way that the moving coil 
canmove withinthe gap, between the soft iron core andthe 
pole pieces.   The function of the soft iron core is (i) to 
decrease the reluctance of the magnetic path betweenthe 
poles and thereby increase the magnetic flux and (ii) to 
make the flux uniformly distributed in the air gap. 
The pointer is attached to one of the spindles, and it moves 
on a graduated scale when the coil is deflected by the 
quantity to be measured. 
Operation: Vvhen the current is passed through the coil, 
the coil experiences a force due to the interaction of the 
magnetic fluxes, produced by the permanent magnet and 
the current in the moving coil. 
We have the force ''F'' in the coil equal to BLIN Newtons

 B   -   The flux density inthe airgap in Webers/

L   -   Theactive length of one conductor   inthe

The current inamperes passing through 
the coil and N is the number   of   turns. 
Torque produced inthe coil 
=   force X perpencicular distance betweenthe centre 
of the conductor to the centre of the spindle in metres. 
 Let us assume the distance as ''r''metres. 
Hence we have 
 Ly   =   FrNewton metres 
 p=   BLINr Newton metres. 
 (F = BLIN Newton) 
 But B,L,Nandrare constants fora particular instrument

 Torque   =   Kl 
 Torque proportional to | 
From the above equation we can infer that the deflecting 
torque ofa PMMC   instrumentis directly proportional tothe 
current, and, therefore, the scale of the PMMC instrument 
is Uniform that is the scale in which the space between 
numbers are equal. 
Hence, while connecting the instrument in   DC the polarity 
should be correctly observed.   Further the instrument will 
not deflect when connected to an AC supply. 
The PMMC instrument could be directly used to measure 
milli or micro amperes as the moving coil can carry a low 
currentonly. With proper shunts, this instrument could be 
used to measure large currents, and with proper series 
resistors, called multipliers, it could be converted into a 
voltmeter. 
Advantages: The PMMC   instrument 
 *   consumes less power

¢   state   the   principle of   moving-iron   instruments - attraction and repulsion type 
*   describe the construction and working of a moving-iron Instrument 
*   state the   use, advantages and disadvantages of moving-iron instruments. 
Moving-iron instruments: This instrument derives its 
 namefromthe fact that a piece of soft iron which is attached 
 to the spindle and needle   moves in a magnetic field, 
produced by the currentor by a current proportional tothe 
quantity of electricity being measured. 
There aretwo types of this instrument which are used either 
as voltmeter or ammeter. 
They are: 
*   attraction type 
*   repulsiontype. 
Principle of operation: The attraction type instrument 
works on the principle of magnetic   attraction, and the 
repulsion   type   instrument works   on   the   principle   of 
magnetic repulsion betweentwo adjacent pieces of soft 
iron,   Magnetised   by   the same magnetic field. 
Construction and working of attraction type moving- 
iron   instrument:   This   instrument   consists   of   an 
electromagnetic coil having anaircore (Fig 1}. Justinfront 
ofthe air core, anoval shapedsoft iron piece is eccentrically 
pivoted ina spindle (Fig 1). 
 Fig 1   o   5 
 COIL 
MOVING IRON 
 ELN259251 
 The spindle is free to move with the help ofthe jewelled 
bearings,   and   the pointer,   which is   attached to the 
spindle, could thus move over the graduated scale. When 
the electromagnetic coilis not connectedto the circuit, the 
soft iron piece hangs vertically down, due to gravitational 
force and the pointer shows zero reading. 
When the electromagnetic coil is connectedto the supply, 
 the magnetic field created inthe coil attracts the soft iron 
 piece (Fig 1). Due to the eccentricity of pivoting of the iron 
piece, the enlarged portion of the   iron piece   is pulled 
towards the coil. Thisinturnmovesthe spindle and makes 
the pointer to deflect. 
Theamount of deflection of the pointer willbe greater when 
the current producing the magneticfield is greater. Further 
the attraction of the soft iron piece is independent onthe 
current direction inthe coil. This characteristic enables the 
instrument to be used both in DC and AC. 
Construction and working of repulsion type moving- 
iron instrument: This instrument consists of acoilwound 
on a brass bobbin B, inside which two strips of soft iron M 
and F are set axially (Fig 2a). Strip F is fixed whereas the 
ironstrip M is attached to the spindle S, which also carries 
the pointer P. 
Spring   control is used, and the instrument is designed 
suchthat when no current is flowing through VY, the pointer 
is at Zero position and   the soft iron strips M and F are 
almost touching. (Fig 2a & 2b) 
VWhen the instrument is connected to the supply, the coil 
Wearries current which inturn produces a magnetic field. 
This field   makes the fixed   and   moving-iron   F and   M 
respectively to produce similar poles inthe ends. Therefore, 
the two strips repel each other. 
The   torque set up produces a deflection of the moving 
system end. Therefore it brings into play a   controling 
torque due to torsion ofthe control springs or weights. The 
moving system comes to rest in such a position that the 
deflecting and controlling torques are equal. 
In this type of instrument, air damping is used commonly 
which is provided by the movement of a piston   P, in   a 
cylindrical air chamber C (Fig 2a). 
Deflecting torque and graduation of scale: However, in 
the   moving-iron   instruments,   the   deflecting   torque   is 
proportional to the square of the current passing through 
the coil.   As such the scale of this instrument will   be

 Inerderto achieve uniformity ofscale, some manufacturers 
have designed tongue shaped strip as   fixed soft iron 
(Fig 4a). 
The fixed iron consists of a tongue-shaped soft iron sheet 
bent into a cylindrical form, while the moving ironis made 
of another soft iron sheet, and isso mounted as to move 
parallel to the fixed iron and towards its narrower end 
 (Fig 4b). 
 The torque,   which is proportional to the square of the 
current, is proportionally reduced by the narrow portion of 
the fixed iron, resulting in more or less even torque and 
thereby uniform scale. 
These instruments are either gravity or spring controlled, 
andthe   damping is achieved by the air friction method 
Uses, advantages and disadvantages of Moving-iron 
instruments 
Uses: They are used as voltmeters and ammeters.

 Advantages 
*   They can be used for both AC and DC, and are hence 
called unpolerized instruments. 
*   Theyhaveasmall value of frictionerrors as the torque/ 
weight ratio is high. 
*   They areless costly when compared tothe movingcoil 
instruments. 
*   They are robust owing to their simple construction. 
*   They have satisfactory accuracy levels within the   limits 
of both precision and industrial grades. 
*   They havescales covering 240°. 
Disadvantages 
*   They have errors due to hysteresis, frequency changes, 
 wave-formand stray magnetic fields. 
 *   They have non-uniform scales commonly.   However,

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the principle of dynamometer type instrument 
¢   describe the   construction,   and   working of the dynamometer type instruments 
*   explain the internal connections of a dynamometer instrument when used as a voltmeter, ammeter and 
 wattmeter 
 *   state the advantages and disadvantages of using the dynamometer instruments. 
Electro-dynamic or Dynamo-meter type Instruments 
Working principle: This Instrument works onthe principle 
of DC motor. Thatis, whenever a current-carrying conductor 
iskeptin a magnetic   field, a force is created and ittends 
to move the conductor away fromthe magneticfield.   Ina 
dynamo- meter instrument, the magneticfieldis produced 
by an electromagnet named as fixed coils. 
The moving coil, either connected inseries or parallel with 
the fixed coil, carries a proportionate current.   Operation 
ofthis instrument in both AC and DC is possible due to the 
fact that when ever the currentreverses iInAC, thecirection 
of   flux   in the fixed coils as well as the direction of flux 
produced   by   moving   coil,   reverses   at the   same time 
resulting inthe same direction of torque. 
Construction: A general arrangement ofthe instrument 
is shownin Fig   1. The main magnetic field is produced by 
the fixed/stationary coil.   This coil   is divided   into two 
sections to give a uniform field in the centre and also to 
allow the moving coil mechanismto be placed in between 
them.

 The fixed coils F and F are placed close together and 
parallelto each other (Fig 2). The aircore section removes 
hysteresis effects when used in AC circuits. The moving 
coil M''is mounted ona spindle *S'' andthe spindle is free 
to move in the air gap with the help of jewelled bearings. 
The pointer *P'' is attached to one end of the spindle and 
the spindle end made to move ona graduated scale GS’. 
The controlling torque is provided by two phosphor-bronze 
springs C'' attachedto the spindle. Furtherthe springs are 
usedto allowthe current ‘in’   and “out framthe moving coil.

 Working:   As shown   in   Fig   3,let the   current   passing 
through the fixed coils be   |.,   and the   current passing 
through the moving coil be |,,.   The field strength will be 
proportional to the current I_.

 The deflecting torque is produced duetothe interactions of 
the magnetic fields produced by the fixed and moving coils 
and will be proportional to the current carried by therm. 
The deflecting torque T, is proportional to |_and |, where 
 |-is the current in the fixed coil and |, is the current in the 
 moving coil. 
From   the   above   torque   equation,   it   is   clear that   the 
instrument when used as voltmeter or ammeter will have 
ununiform scale due to the square law response. 
However, when used as a wattmeter, the instrument will 
have uniform scale. 
Connection   of this   instrument   requires   modification 
depending up on the usage viz, ammeter, voltmeter or 
wattmeter as explained below. 
Dynamometer   instrument   as   an   ammeter:   This

As the moving coil is made by winding small gauge (thin) 
wire, the above connection is unsuitable for measuring 
heavy currents. 
When the instrument is to be converted as an ammeter to 
measure   large currents,   the moving coil   is connected 
across a shunt (Fig 5). Both AC and DC, measurements 
are possible.

Digital Ammeter 
Digital Ammeters are instruments thatmeasure the current 
in ampere and display it in digital. These instruments 
provide   information   about current   drawn   and   current 
continuty to help users troubleshoot electric loads. 
They have both positive and negative leads and low internal 
resistance. Digitalammeters are connected inseries with 
a circuit so that current flow passes through the meter. 
It can be used to measure the A.C and D.C. Many digital 
ammeters include a current sensor built in the meter. 
 Features: 
 Different types of digital ammeters can measure different 
ranges of A.C current and D.C current and also A.C 
frequency. 
Batteries are providedinitto operate without plug-in-power 
and suitable for cutcoor use Fig 1 shows a   typical digital 
ammeter.

 Standards : 
 Digital ammeters must have a certain   standards and 
specifications to ensure proper design and functionality 
refer IEC 600 91 - 2. 
Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   distinguish between analogue and digital voltmeter 
*   list out the advantage of DVM 
*   explain the working principle of DVM. 
Digital Volt Meter (DVM) : 
The Digital Volt Meter(DVM) is an electrical measureing 
instrument   which   is   used   to   measure   line   potential 
difference (P.D) between two points. The voltage to be 
measured may be AC or DC. 
Digital voltmeters display the value of AC or DC voltage 
being measured directly as discrete numerical instead of

Working Principle of Digital Voltmeter: 
The block diagram of a simple digital voltmeter is shown 
in the Fig 1   It consists the following blocks

3   AND gate: 
4   Decimal Display 
Working (Fig 2) 
«   Unknown voltage signal is fed to the pulse generator 
which generates a pulse whose width is proportional to 
the input signal. 
¢   Output of pulse generator is fed to one leg of theAND 
gate.

a «   The input signal to the other leg of the AND gate is 
train of pulses. 
*   Outputof AND gate is positive triggeredtrainof duration 
same as the width of the pulse generated by the pulse 
generator. 
*   This postitive triggeredtrainis fedto the inverter which 
 converts it into a negative triggered train. 
 ¢   Output of the inverter isfedto a counter which counts 
the   number   of   triggers   in   the   duration   which   is 
proportional   to the   input signal   i.e.   voltage   under 
measurement 
This counter can be calibrated to indicate voltage in volts 
converts an analog signal intoatrain of pulses, the number 
is proportional to the input signal. So a digital voltmeter 
can be made by using any one of the A/D conversion 
methods (Fig 3) 
Now-a- days digital voltmeters are also replaced by digital 
multi meters due to its multitasking feature.

 Wattmeters 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the advantages of measuring power directly 
*   explain the construction and working of the induction type single phase wattmeter. 
Advantages of measuring power supply 
Power in a single phase AC circuit can be calculated by 
using anammeter, a voltmeter and a power   factor meter 
with the help of the formula 
Power in a single phase circuit = EI Cos @ watts. 
To get an on the spot true power reading, a wattmeter is 
 used. The power dissipated in the circuit can be read 
 directly fromthe scale of the meter. The wattmeter takes 
the power factor of the circuit into account and always 
indicates the true power. 
Types of wattmeters 
There are three types of wattmeters in use as stated below. 
*   Dynamometerwattmeter 
¢   Induction wattmeter 
 *   Electrostatic wattmeter 
 Amongthe three, the electrostatic type is very rarely used. 
Information given here is for the other two types only. 
Dynamometer type, single   phase wattmeter: This type 
is commonly used as a wattmeter. 
Dynanometer used as   a Wattmeter: The dynamometer 
is   commonly used as a wattmeter to measure power in 
both AC and DC circuits and will have uniform scale. 
Yhen this instrument is used as a wattmeter, the fixed 
coils are treated as current coil, and the moving coil is 
made   as   pressure   coil   with   necessary   multiplier 
resistance (Fig 1).

 Advantages 
 «   This instrument can be used both in AC and DC. 
 *   As this is an air cored instrument, the hysteresis and 
eddy current losses are eliminated. 
*   This instrument has better accuracy. 
«   When used as wattmeter, the scale is uniform. 
Disadvantages 
«   It is more expensive than   PMMC and   moving iron 
instruments. 
 *   When used as voltmeter or ammeter the scale will net 
be uniform. 
 *   It   has   a   low   torqueAveight   ratio-as   such   has   low 
sensitivity. 
*   Sensitive foroverloads and mechanicalimpact. Hence 
careful handling is necessary. 
*   lItconsumes more power than PMMC meters. 
Induction type single phase wattmeter: This type of 
wattmeters could be used only in AC circuits whereas a 
dynamometer type wattmeter could be used in both AC 
and DC circuits. 
Inductiontype wattmeters are useful only when the supply 
voltage and frequency are almost constant. 
Construction: Induction wattmeters having two different 
types of magnetic cores (Figs 2a and 2b). 
Both the types have one pressure coil magnet and one 
current coil magnet. The pressure coil carries a current 
 proportionalto the voltage whereas the current coil carries 
 the load current. 
Athin aluminium disc is mounted on a spindle in between 
the space of the magnets and its movement is controlled 
by springs. The spindle carries a weightless pointer atone 
end. 
Working: The alternating magnetic fluxes produced by the 
pressure and current coils cut the aluminium disc and 
produce eddy currents in the disc. Due to the interaction 
between the fluxes and the eddy currents a deflecting 
torque is produced inthe disc and the disc tries to move. 
Control springs attached to the two ends of the spindle 
control the deflection and the pointer shows the power in 
watts ona graduated scale. 
Shaded rings provided inthe pressure coil (shunt) magnet 
could be adjusted in orderto cause the resultant fluxinthe

 Method   of connecting   wattmeter   in   single   phase 
circuits - pressure coil connection to reduce errone- 
 ous measurement. 
 There are two ways of connecting the pressure coil of the 
wattmeter (Fig 3). 
Both the methods shown in Figs 3a & b need correction in 
power measurement due to the reasons stated below. 
Inthe method of connection showninFig 3a, the pressure 
coilisconnectedonthe ‘supply’ side ofthe current coil, and 
hence, the error in power measurement is due to the fact 
thatthe voltage applied tothe voltage coilis higher thanthat 
oftheload onaccountofthe voltage drop inthe current coil. 
Assucnthewattmeter measures the load power inaddition 
to the power lost inthe current coil. 
On the other hand, in the method of connection shown in 
Fig 3b, the current coil carries the small current taken by 
the voltage coil,   in addition to the load current, thereby 
introducing errors in power measurement. As such the 
wattmeter measures the load   power in addition to the 
power lost inthe pressure coil. 
Ifthe load current is small, the voltage drops inthe current 
coill willbe small, so thatthe method of connection, shown 
in   Fig   3a,   introduces a very   small   error and,   hence, 
preferable. 
Onthe other hand, ifthe load current is large the power lost 
inthe pressure coil will be negligible   when compared to the 
 load   power   in   the   method   of connection   shown   in 
 Fig   3b,   and,   hence,   a very   small   error ts   introduced 
resulting inthe preference of this connection.

 3-Phase   Wattmeter 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   describe the various types of 3-phase wattmeters, their connections 
*   state how to connect different types of 3 phase watt meter. 
Insingle-phase wattmeters there   will be one setof pressure 
andcurrent coils driving a single aluminiumdisc, whereas 
in2-element, three phase wattmeters there will betwo sets 
of pressure and current coils driving a single aluminium 
disc (Fig 1a) or driving two aluminium discs mounted onthe 
same shaft (Fig 1b) thereby providing a torque proportional 
to the 3-phase power.

three sets of pressure and current coils kept at   120°to each 
other   but   driving   a   single   aluminium   disc   (Fig   2)   or 
alternatively 3 sets of pressure and current coils driving 
three discs one over the other but mounted on the same

 The principle and working of an induction type wattmeter 
are similar to the induction type energy meter. The only 
difference in construction between the energy meter and 
wattmeter is that the spindle of the wattmeter is spring- 
controlled, has a pointer but no train of gears. 
However to summarise what has been learnt earlier the

Digital wattmeter 
The wattmeter is an instrument for measuring the electric 
power   in watts of any given   circuit.   Electromagnetic 
wattmeters are used for measurment of utility frequency 
and audio frequency and audio frequency power: other 
types are requiredfor racio frequency. 
Fig 1   shows the block diagram of digital wattmeter. 
Digital   wattmeters   measure   current   and   voltage 
electronically thousands of times a second, multiplying 
the results ina computer microcontroller chipto determine 
watts. The computer can also perform statistics such as 
peak, average, low watts consumed. Theycan monitorthe 
power line forvoltage surges and outages. Digital electronic 
wattmeter,   have   become   popular   for   conveniently 
measuring power consumption in household appliances 
with saving energy and money.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
¢   describe the construction and   working principle of single phase energy meters 
*   state and explain creeping error in energy meter. 
Necessity of energy meter: The electrical energy supplied 
by the Electricity board should be billed,   based on the 
actual amount of energy consumed. VVe need a device to 
measure the energy supplied to   a consumer.   Electrical 
energy is measured in kilowatt hours in practice.   The 
meter used for this is an energy meter. 
Principle of a single phase   induction type energy 
meter: The operation ofthis   meter depends onthe induction 
principle. Two alternating magneticfields produced by two 
coils induce current ina disc and produce a torque to rotate 
it(disc). One coil (potential coil) carries current proportional 
to the voltage of the supply and the other (current coil) 
carriesthe load current. (Fig1) Torque is proportionalto the 
power as in wattmeter.

consideration. The instantaneous speed   is proportional to 
the power passing through it. 
The total number of revolutionsinagiventimeis proportional 
to the total energy that passes through the meter during 
that period oftime. 
Parts and functions ofan energy meter: The parts ofthe 
induction type single phase energy meter are (Fig 1). 
lron core: It is specially shaped to direct the   magnetic flux 
inthe desired path.   It directs the magnetic lines of force, 
reduces leakage flux andalso reduces magnetic reluctance. 
Potential coil(voltage coil): The potential coil is connected 
across the load and is wound with many turns of fine wire. 
It induces eddy current in the aluminium disc. 
Current coil: The current coils, connected in series with 
load, are wound with a few turns of thick wire, since they 
must carry the full load current. 
Disc: The disc is the rotating element inthe meter, and is 
mounted ona vertical spindle whichhas aworm gear at one 
end. The discis madeofaluminiumandis positioned inthe 
air gap between the potential and current cail magnets. 
Spindle: The spindle ends have hardened steel pivots. The 
pivotis supported bya jewelbearing. There is awormgear 
at one end ofthe spindle. As the gear turns the dials, they 
indicate the amount of energy passing through the meter. 
Permanent   magnet/brake   magnet:   The   permanent 
magnet restrains the aluminium disc from racing ata high 
speed.   It produces an opposing torque that acts against 
the turning torque of the aluminium disc. 
Functioning   of energy meters: The rotation of the 
aluminium disc (Fig2)isaccomplished by an electromagnet, 
which consists of a potential coil and current coils.   The 
potential coil is connected across the load.   It induces an 
eddy current in the aluminium disc.   The eddy current 
produces a magnetic field which reacts with the magnetic 
field produced by the current coils to produce a driving 
torque on the disc. 
The speed of rotation of the aluminium disc is proportional 
to the product of the amperes (inthe current coils) andthe 
volts (across the potential coil).   The total electrical energy 
that is consumed bythe load is proportional to the number 
of revolutions made by the disc during a given period of 
time. 
Asmall copper ring(shading ring) or coil (shading coil} is 
placed inthe air gap under the potential coil, to produce a 
forward torque, large enough to counteract any friction 
produced by the rotating aluminium disc.

 This counter torque is produced whenthe aluminium 
disc   rotates   in the   magnetic field established   by the 
permanent magnet. The eddy currents, in turn, producea 
magnetic field that reacts with the field of the permanent 
magnet, causing a restraining actionthat is proportional to 
the speed ofthe disc 
Creeping error and adjustment:   |n some meters the 
disc rotates continuously even when there is no current 
flow through the currentcoili.e. when only the pressure coil 
isenergised. Thisiscalledcreeping. The majorcause for 
creeping   is over-compensation for friction.   The other 
causes for creeping are excessive voltage across the 
pressure coil, vibrations and stray magnetic fields. 
In order to prevent creeping, two diameterically opposite 
holes are drilled in the disc (Fig 3). The disc will come to 
rest with one of the holes under the edge of a pole of the 
potential coil magnet, the rotation being thus limited to a 
maximum of half a revolution.

 *   describe the functional operation of digital type energymeter from block diagram. 
Electronic (Digital energy meter) 
 This meters measure the energy using highly integrated 
components and it digitizs the instantaneous voltage and 
currentin ahigh-resolution sigma-delta analogueto digital 
converter (ADC), gives the instantaneous power in watts. 
 Integration overtime gives energy Used measured inkilo- 
Watt hour. The block diagram for a digital meteris shown

COMPORT 
 The voltage sensor built arqund 4 step down element and 
potential divider network sensors both the phase voltage 
andloadvaltage. 
 The second sensoris a currentsensor, which senses the 
current drawn by the load at any pointintime . 
 It''s inbuilt around a current transformer and other active 
devices (voltage comparator) which converts thesensed 
current to voltage for processing. The output from both 
sensors is thenfed into   a signal (voltage) conditionerwhich 
ensures matched voltage (or) signal level to the control 
circuit containing multiplexer. Itenables sequential switching 
of both signal to the analogue input of the Peripheral 
 Interface Controller(PIC}. 
 The control circuit centred on a PIC integrated circuit. It 
contains ten bitanaloqueto digital converter(ADC) flexiole 
to program and good for peripheral interfacing. 
 The ADC converts the analoque signals to its digital 
equivalent, both signals from the voltage and current 
sensors are then multiplied by the means of embedded 
 software inthe PIC. 
The error correction is taken as the offset correction by 
detemining the value   of the input quality in the short 
circuited inputand storingthis value in the mem ory for use 
as the correction value device calioration. 
 ThePIC isprogrammedin''C'' lanquage Itstimulatesto use 
the receiveddatata calculate powerconsumption perhour, 
aswell asthe expected charges. These are displayed oan 
 the liquid crystal display (LCD) attached to the circuit. 
 Fig 2 shows theimage of a digital energy meter. 
Acvantages 
DIGITAL electronic meters are much more accurate than 
electromechanicalmeters. There arenomoving parts and,

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   list the various types of 3-phase energy meters 
*   describe the construction and working of a 3-phase 3-wire induction type energy meter 
*   describe the construction and working of a 3-phase 4-wire induction type energy meter 
*   state the application of a 3-phase 3-wire and 3-phase 4-wire energy meter. 
3-phase energy meters: Even though different types of 
energy meters are available, the induction type energy 
meter is most commonly used because it is simple in 
construction, less in cost and requires less maintenance. 
The function of a 3-phase energy meter is similartothat of 
a single phase energy meter. 
Types of 3-phase energy meters 
There are two types of 3-phase energy meters mainly. 
*   Three phase 3-wire energy meters (3-phase 2- element 
energy meter) 
*   Three phase 4wire energy meters (3-phase 3- element 
energy meter) 
Two   element 3-phase energy meters:   This   energy 
meter works on the principle of measurement of power by 
the two wattmeter method. Two elements of a current coil 
and two elements ofa potential coilare used inthis energy 
meter. These assemblies can be arranged onthe different 
sectors   in   a   horizontal   position   (Fig   1)   with   a   single 
aluminium disc which rotates between the poles of asingle 
braking magnet.

 The two elements can also have individual driving discs on 
a common spindle. In this case they will have individual 
braking magnets (Fig 2). The second type usually preferred 
by the manufacturers due to the construction simplicity. 
In both the cases the driving torque produced by individual 
elements are   summed   up.   The   recording   mechanism 
which is attached to the train of gears i.e., cyclometer or 
counter type dial shows the sum of the energies that has 
passed through the elements. The two element energy 
meter is only suitable for a 3-phase 3-wire system but can 
be used for both balanced and unbalanced loads. 
3-element 3-phase energy meter: This works on the 
same principle as thatofthe 3 wattmeter method of power 
measurement with a 3-phase load. Here 3 units, eachwith 
a current coil and a potential coil, are used. The potential 
coils of the 3 elements are connected in star to the supply 
lines with their common point connected to the neutralline 
of power supply.

 The current coils are connected in series to the individual 
lines. As is the case with the two element energy meter, 
these three elements can be arranged in the different 
sectors of   acommon single aluminium disc which serves 
as a rotating part connected to driving dial (Fig 3).

 The three elements can also have acommon spindle with 
three individual discs and braking magnets (Fig 4). Here 
also the 2nd type is usually preferred by manufacturers due 
tothe easiness inconstruction. The driving torque produced 
by the three individual elements are summed up and the 
recording mechanism shows the sum of energies that has 
passed through the   individual elements. This energy meter 
is suitable for the 3-phase 4-wire system. 
Application of 3-phase energy meter: A two element 3- 
phase energy meter is used with three phase loads in 
which a neutral   is not used such as for an industry or 
irrigation pumpset motors etc. having three phase loads 
only or withan 11k¥V 3-phase 3-wire supply to an industry. 
A3-phase 4-wire elementenergy meter is used withthree 
phase load in which balanced or unbalanced loads are 
connected with individual phases and neutral suchas fora

 Errors and   corrrection   in   energy   meter   measurement 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the errors caused by the driving system and the braking system in energy meters 
*   explain the different adjustments provided for correcting the errors in energy meters. 
Errors caused by thedriving system 
Incorrect magnitude of fluxes: This may   be due to 
abnormal values of current or voltage. The shunt magnet 
flux may be in error due to changes in resistance of coil or 
due to abnormal frequencies. 
Incorrect phase angles: There may not be a proper 
relationship between the various phasors.   This may be 
due to improper lag adjustment, abnormal frequencies, 
change in resistance with temperature etc. 
Lack of symmetry in magnetic circuit: If the magnetic 
circuit is not symmetrical, a driving torque is produced 
which makes the meter creep. 
Error caused by the braking system 
They are: 
*   changes inthe strength of the brake magnet 
«   changes in the disc resistance 
*   self-braking effect of series magnet flux 
*   abnormal friction of the moving parts. 
Adjustments are provided for correcting the errors in the 
energy meters so that they read correctly and their errors 
are within acceptable limits. 
Preliminary light load adjustment: The rated voltage is 
applied to the potential coil with no current through the 
current coil and the light load device is adjusted until the 
disc just fails to   start.   The   electromagnet   is slightly 
adjusted to make the holes in the disc to take   a position 
in between the poles ofthe electromagnets. 
Full load unity power factor adjustment: The pressure 
coilis connected across the rated supply voltage and the 
rated full   load current at unity power factor is passed 
throughthe current coils. The position ofthe brake magnet 
is adjusted to vary the braking torque so that the meter 
revolves at the correct speed within the required limits of 
 error. 
 LAG adjustments (Low power factor adjustments): The 
pressure coilis connected acrossthe rated supply voltage 
andthe rated fullload current is passed through the current 
coilat0.5P.F. lagging. The lag device is adjusted till the 
meter runs at the correct speed. 
Rated   supply voltage:   By adjusting the rated supply 
voltage, with the rated full load current and unity power 
factor, the speed of the meter is checked and the full load 
unity power factor and low power factor adjustments are 
repeated until the desired accuracy limits are reached for 
both the conditions. 
Light   load   adjustment:   The   rated   supply voltage   is 
applied across the pressure coil and a very low current 
(about 5%   of   full load current) is passed through the meter 
atunity power factor. Lightload adjustment is done so that 
the meter runs at the correct speed. 
Fullload unity power factor: Light load adjustments are 
again done until the speed is correct for both loads i.e. full 
load as well as light loads. 
Creep adjustment:   As a final check on the light load 
adjustment, the pressure coil is excited by   110 percent of 
the rated voltage with Zero load current.   If the light load 
adjustment is correct, the meter should not creep under 
these conditions.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the construction of multimeter 
*   explain the working priniciple of analog multimeter 
*   explain the method of measuring direct / alternating voltages and current with a multimeter 
explain the method of measuring resistance by a multimeter 
*   explain the precautions to be observed while measuring voltage, current and resistance in the circuit. 
Asingle instrument usedfor measuring current voltage and 
resistance is known as a multimeter. Itis a portable, multi 
range instrument. 
Ithasafullscale deflection accuracy of +1.5 %. The lowest 
sensitivity of multimeters for   AC voltage range is 5   Kohms/ 
volts and forthe DC voltage range itis 20 K ochms/volts. The 
lowest range of DC is more sensitive thanthe otherranges. 
Figs 1 show typical multimeters. 
 Construction of a multimeter 
 A multimeter uses a single meter movementwithascale 
calibrated involts, ohms and milliamperes. The necessary 
multiplier resistors and shunt resistors are all contained 
withinthe case. Front panelselectorswitches are provided 
to selecta particular meterfunction anda   particular range 
for that function. 
On some   multimeters, two switches are   used,   one to 
select a function, andthe other the range. Some multimeters 
 Fig 1   do not have switches for this purpose; instead, they have 
 separate jacks for each function and range. 
Batteries/cells fixed inside the meter case provide the 
power supply for the resistance measurement. 
The meter movement is that of the moving coilsystem as 
used in DC ammeters and voltmeters. 
Rectifiers are provided insidethe meterto convert AC to DC 
inthe AC measurement circuit. 
Parts of a multimeter 
A standard multimeter consists of the   main parts and 
controls (Fig 2). 
Controls 
The meter is set to measure the current, voltage (AC and 
DC) or resistance by means ofthe FUNCTION switch. Inthe 
example given in Fig 3 the switch is set to mA, AC.

 The scale of current and voltage is uniformly graduated. 
The scale of the ohmmeter is non-linear. 
The scale is usually ‘backward’, with zero at the right. 
Principle of working 
A   circuitry when working   as   an   ammeter. (Fig 8) 
Shunt resistors across the meter movement bypass current 
in excess of 0.05 mA at fsd. A suitable value of shunt 
resistor   is   selected   through   the   range   switch   for the 
required range of current measurement. 
A   circuitry when working   as   a   voltmeter. (Fig 7) 
The voltage drop across the meter coil is dependent onthe 
currentand the coil resistance. To incicate voltages greater 
than50 mV at fsdas per the circuit, multiplier resistances 
of different values are connected in series with the meter 
movement through the range switchfor the required range 
of measurement. 
A circuitry   when   working as an ohmmeter. (Fig 8) 
To measure resistance, the leads are connected across 
the external resistorto be measured (Fig 8). This connection 
completes the   circuit,   allowing   the   internal   battery to 
produce current throughthe meter coil, causing deflection 
of the pointer,   proportional to the value of the external 
resistance being measured. 
Zero adjustment 
Vhenthe ohmmeter leads are open, the pointer is atfullleft 
scale, indicating infinite (¥) resistance (opencircuit). When 
the leads are shorted, the pointer is at full right scale, 
indicating zero resistance. 
The purpose of the variable resistor isto adjust the current 
so that the pointer is at exactly zero when the leads are 
shorted.   It is used to compensate for changes in the 
internal battery voltage due to aging. 
Multiple range 
Shunt (parallel)   resistors are   used to provide   multiple 
ranges so that the meter can measure resistance values 
from very small to very large ones. The reading on the 
ohmmeter scale is multiplied by the factor indicated by the 
range setting. 
Remember, an ohmmeter must not be connected 
toacircuitwhenthe circuit''s power is on. Always

Digital Multimeter 
Ina digital multimeter the meter movement is replaced by 
adigital readout (Fig 1 and 2). This readoutis similar to that 
used in electronic calculators. The internal circuitry of the 
digital multimeter is made up   of   digital, integrated circuits. 
Like the analog-type multimeter, the digital multimeter has 
afront panel switching arrangement.

 The quantity measured is displayed in the form of a four 
digit   number with a properly placed decimal point. VVhen 
DC quantities are measured the polarity is identified by 
‘+ve’   or ‘-ve’   sign displayed to the left of the   number 
indicating the probes are connected correctly by +ve sign 
and probes are reversely connected by -ve sign.

are the same as those on analouge multimeters.   That is 
it can measure:- 
*   ohms 
*   DCvoltage andcurrent 
«   ACvoltageand current 
Some DMMs provide special functions such as transistor 
or   diode   test,   power   measurement,   and   decibel 
measurement for audio amplifier tests. 
DMM displays: DMMsare available with either LCD (liquid 
-crystal display) or LED (light-emitting diode} read-outs. 
The LCD is the most commonly used read-out in battery- 
powered instruments due to the fact that it draws very small 
amount of current. 
A typical battery-powered DMM with an LCD read-out 
 operates ona 9V battery that will last from afew hundred 
 hourste 2000 hoursand more. The disadvantages of LCD 
read-outs are that (a) they are   difficultor impossible to see 
in poor light conditions, and (b) they are relatively slow 
response to measurement changes. 
LEDs, on the other hand, can be seen in the dark, and 
respond quickly to changes inmeasuredvalues. LEDdisplays 
require much more current than LCDs,   and,   therefore, 
battery life is shortened when they are used in portable 
equipment. 
BothLCD andLED-DMM   displays are ina sevensegment 
format (Fig 3).

 Frequency   meter 
 Multimeter: Safety precautions: The following safety 
precautions should always be taken. 
 *   Never use the ohnmmeter section ona   live circuit. 
 «   Never connect the ammeter section in parallel witha 
voltage source. 
«   Never overload the ammeter or voltmeter sections by 
attempting to   measure   currents   or voltages far   in 
excess of the range switch setting. 
*   Checkthe metertest leads forfrayed or brokeninsulation 
before working with them.   If damaged insulation is 
found the test leads should be replaced. 
*   Avoid touching the bare metal clips or tips of the test 
probes. 
«   Whenever possible, removethe supply before connecting 
the meter test leads into the circuit. 
Applications   of Digital   multimeter:   A   multimeter   is 
used for testing and fault finding in electrical/electronic 
circuits, electrical appliances and machines. Amultimeter 
isa portable handy instrument used for 
*   checking continuity of circuit, appliances and devices. 
*   measuring/checkingthe supply presence atthe source 
¢   for testing components like capacitors, diodes,   and 
transistors for checking their condition. 
*   measuring the current drawn by the circuit. 
*   measuring resistance ofthe electrical appliances and 
devices. 
Note:   Some   meters   have   provision   also   for 
temperature measurement with suitable sensing 
probes. 
Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the types of frequency meters 
*   describe the principle, construction and working ofa   mechanical   resonance   (vibrating   reed)   type   fre- 
quency meter. 
The following types of frequency meters are used for 
measuring powerfrequencies. 
«   Mechanicalresonance type 
¢   Electrical resonance type 
*   Electro-dynamictype 
«   Electro-cdynamometer type 
*   Weston type 
«   Ratiometertype 
*   Saturable core type 
The explanation given here is for mechanical resonance 
type frequency meter only as indicated below. 
The trainees are advised to refer to books on electrical 
measuring instruments for learning about the other types 
offrequency meters. 
Mechanical resonance type frequency meter (vibra- 
tion reed type) 
Principle: The vibration reed type frequency metershown 
inFig 1 works onthe principle of naturalfrequency. Every 
object in the world has its natural frequency, depending 
upon its weight and dimensions.   VVhen an object is kept 
inavibrating medium, it starts vibrating, ifthe frequency of 
the medium attains the natural frequency of the object.

 Construction:   Mechanical   resonance   type frequency 
meters consist of an eletromagnet and a set of metallic 
reeds arranged in front of the electromagnet.   The fre- 
quency   meter   is   connected   across the   supply   like   a 
voltmeter, taking care about the voltage rating (Fig 2) .

 Fig 3 shows the shape of the reed and these reeds are of 
about 4mm wide and 0.5 mmthick. One end of the reed 
is fitted ona base, andthe other overhanging end carries 
a white painted surface as the indicator and sometimes 
referred to as flag. 
The reeds are arranged ina row and the natural frequency 
of the reeds differs by 1/2 cycle. This 1/2 cycle difference 
is possible between the reeds due to the difference inthe 
weights of the   reeds.   The   reeds are arranged   in an 
ascending order (Fig 4a), and generally the natural frequency 
of the   centre   reed   is the same   as that of the supply 
frequency (50Hz).

 Working: VVhen the frequency meter is connected to the 
supply, the electromagnet produces a magneticfield which 
alternates at the rate of the supply frequency. The reed, 
which has its natural frequency coincident with that of the 
alternating magneticfield, vibrates more thanthe adjacent 
reeds Fig 4(b). 
 ELN2Z59483 
 The flag ofthis vibrating reed makes it possible to note the 
frequency of the supply from the scale marking of the 
frequency meter. Thoughthe other reeds also vibrate, Fig 
A(b), their magnitude willbe muchless thanthe reed whose 
natural frequency is exactly in coincidence with the supply 
frequency.

 Advantages and disadvantages 
The reed type frequency meter has the following advan- 
tages. 
The indications are independent of i) the wave formofthe 
applied voltage and ii) magnitude of the applied voltage, 
provided thatthe voltage is nottoo low. Ata low voltage the 
flag indication of the reed will not be reliable. 
The disadvantages arethe meter cannot read closer than 
halfthe cycle frequency difference between adjacent reeds

A frequency   counter   is a   digital   instrument that   can 
measure   and   display   the   frequency   of   any   periodic 
waveform. ltoperates onthe principle of gatingthe unknown 
input signal into the counter for a predetermined time. 
Ifthe unknowninput signal were gated into the counter for 
exactly 1 second, the number of counts allowed into the 
counter would be the frequency of the input signal. The 
term gated comes fromthe fact thatan ANDoran OR gate 
is employed forallowing the unknown input signal into the 
counter to be accumulated. Fig 1

 ELN259401  BLOCK DIAGRAM OF FREQUENCY COUNTER 
 Discription of block diagram: 
The simplified form of block diagram of frequency counter 
is in Fig 1.   It consists of   a counter with its associated 
display/decoder circuitry, clock oscillator,   adividerandan 
AND gate. The counter is usually made up of cascaded 
Binary Coded Decimal{BCD) counters and the display/ 
decoder unit converts the BCD outputs into a decimal 
display for easy monitoring. 
AGATE ENABLE signal of known time period is generated 
with a clock oscillator and a divider circuit and is applied 
to one leg of an AND gate. 
The unknown signal is applied to the other leg of the AND 
gate and acts as the clock for the counter. The counter 
advances one count for each transition of the unknown 
signal,   and at the end of the known time interval,   the 
 Power   factor   meter 
 contents of the counter will be equal to the number of 
periods of the unknown input signal that have occurred 
duringtime interval, t. Inotherwords, the counter contents 
will be proportional to the frequency of the unknown input 
signal. 
For instance if the gate signal is of a time of exactly 1 
second and the unknown input signal is a 600-Hz square 
wave, atthe end of 1   sécond the counter will counts upto 
600, which is exactly the frequency ofthe unknown input 
signal 
The wave formin Fig 2 shows that a clear pulse is applied 
to the counter at t, to set the counter at zero. Prior to t., 
the GATE ENABLE signal is LOW, and so the output of 
the AND gate will be LOW and the counter will not be 
counting. The GATE ENABLE goes HIGH fromt,t, t,and 
during this time   interval t=(t, -t, ) the unknown input signal 
pulses will pass throughthe AND gate and will be counted 
by the counter 
After t,, the AND gate output will be again LOW and the 
counter will stop counting. Thus, the counter will have 
counted the number of pulses that occurred during the 
 time interval, t of the GATE ENABLE SIGNAL, and the 
 resulting contents of the counter are a direct measure of 
the frequency ofthe input signal.

 ELN259402  DIFFERENT WAVEFORMS IN A FREQUENCY COUNTER 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the construction and connection of 3-phase dynamometer type power factor meter 
*   explain the construction, connection and operation of a 3-phase moving iron type power factor meter 
*   explain the construction, connection and operation of a single phase moving iron type power factor meter. 
3-phase dynamometer type power factor meter for 
balanced   load:   Fig   1   shows   the   construction   and 
connections of a 3-phase power factor meter used for 
balanced loads. 
Inthis meter, the field coils are connected inseries withthe 
load along with one phase.   The two moving coils are rigidly 
attached to each other at an angle of   120°. These coils are 
connected   to   two   different   phases.   A   resistance   is 
connected in series with each coil. 
Phase splitting through reactance Is not necessary since 
the required phase displacement between currents in the 
two moving coils can be obtained by the supply itself.

 ELN259401  DYNAMOMMETER TYPE THREE PHASE POWER FACTOR METER 
 Since the currents inthe two moving coils are both affected 
inthe same way by any change infrequency or wave-form, 
this meter is independent of frequency and wave-form. 
Moving iron power factor meters: This type of power 
factor meter is more popular than the dynamometer type 
due to the following advantages. 
*   Torque-weight ratio (working forces) islargecompared 
to the dynamometer type meter. 
¢   Asallthecoilsarefixedthere is no ligament connection 
 necessary. 
 «   The scale can be extended to 360°. 
*   This meter is simple and robust in construction. 
*   Comparatively cheaper incest. 
Fig 2 shows the construction and connection of a moving 
irontype power factor meter used for balanced loads. 
 There are three similar coils at C,, C, and C, placed 120° 
 degrees apart and connected to 3-phase supply directly 
(Fig2) orthrough the secondary ofthe currenttransformers. 
 Coil P is placed in the middle of the three coils C,, C, and 
 C,and connected in series with a resistance across two 
lines of the supply. Inside the coil Pthere are are two vanes 
V,, and V., mounted at the ends of a freely moving spindle 
but   kept at   180° to   each other.   The   spindle   also   has 
damping vanes and the pointer .

 MOVING IRON TYPE POWER-FACTOR METER 
FOR A BALANCED 3-PHASE LOAD 
 ELN258402 
 The rotating magnetic field produced by the three coils C.,, 
 C,andC, interacts with the flux produced by the coil P. This 
causes the moving system to take up an angular position 
 depending upon the phase angle of the current. 
Single   phase   moving   iron   power factor   meter:   A 
single phase moving iron power factor meter (Fig 3) uses 
a phase splitting network comprising of   a capacitor, an 
inductor and a resistor. 
3-phase power factor meters for unbalanced load: For 
measurement of power factor in 3-phase   unbalanced 
systems 2-element or 3-element power   factor meters with 
each element witha currentcoiland pressure coil is used. 
The pressure coils are (moving coils) similar to that of 
single phase P.F. meters are mounted one below the other 
onasingle spindle. The pointer shows   the resultant power 
factor.

 SINGLE PHAGE MOVING IRON TYPE POWER FACTOR METER 
 Measurement of 3 phase power by single and two wattmeters 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the measurement 3 phase power using single wattmeter 
*   explain the measurement of 3 phase power using two wattmeters 
*   calculate the power factor by two wattmeter method power measurement. 
The measurement of power: The number of wattmeters 
usedto obtain power inathree-phase system depends on

 The two wattmeter method of measuring power 
Power in-a three-phase, three-wire system is normally 
measured bythe   two-wattmeter'' method. Itmay be used 
 with balanced orunbalanced loads,and separate connec- 
 tionsto the phases are not required. This methad isnot, 
however usedin four-wire systems because currentmay 
 flow in the fourth wire, ifthe load is unbalanced and the 
 assumption that I+ 1, +1, =0 will not be valid. 
The twowattmeters are connected ta the supply system 
(Fig 2).   The current   coils of the two wattmeters are 
connected in tvo of the lines, and the voltage coils are 
connected framthe same two lines tathe third line. The 
totalpoweristhen obtained by adding the two readings: 
 P= P+P,. 
 Consider the total instantaneous power inthe system P = 
 Po+Pi+P where P,,Pand Pare the instantaneousvalues

 the mean powers read by the two wattmeters. 
Itis possiblethatwith the wattmeters connected correctly, 
one of them-willattemptto read aneqative value because 
ofthe large phase angle between the voltage and current 
for that instrument. The current coil or voltage coil must 
then be reversed and the reading given a negative sign 
when combined with the otherwattmeterreadingsto obtain 
the total power. 
At unity power factor the readings oftwowattmeterwillbe 
equal. Total power=2 x one wattmeter reading. 
Whenthepowertactor=0.5 one ofthewattmetersreading 
is zera and the other reads total power. 
When   the   power factor   is less   than   0.5,   one   of the 
wattmeters willgive negative indication. Inarderto read the 
wattmeter, reversethe pressure coilorcurrent coil connec-

mustbhe taken as negative for calculating the total power. 
When the power factor is zero, the readings of the two 
wattreters are equal butofopposite signs.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
* state the necessity of tong-testers 
¢ state the construction and working of a tong-tester 
¢ state the precautions to be observed while using a tong-tester. 
 Atong-tester is an instrument devisedfor the measurement 
of A.C current, without interrupting the circuit.   It is also 
called clip-onammeter, or sometimes a clamp-on ammeter 
 (Fig 1}.

 Working principle 
The instrument can function only when current passes 
through its deflecting system. It works under the mutual 
induction principle. 
Electromagnetic induction: When a changing flux is 
linked with the coil, an emf is induced in the coil. The 
current in a coil so produced changes as that of   the 
changing   magnetic flux. fan alternating currentis   flowing 
through the coil,   the   magnetic flux   produced   is also 
alternative i.e. changing continuously. (Fig 2) 
 Fig 2 
 ELN259612 
 Placing another coil (2) in the changing flux of coil (1), an 
emf will be induced. (Fig 3) 
Fig 3 
 ELN259613 
 This induced emf willsend the current, causing deflection 
ofthe meter. Introduction of a magnetic core between the 
coils increases the   induced emf. The coil (1)   is called 
primary and the coil (2) is called secondary. 
 Construction: Fig 4 shows a tong-tester (the clamp-on 
 ammeter)   circuit.   The   split-core   meter   consists   of   a 
secondary coil with   the   split-core and   a   rectifier type 
instrument connected to the secondary. The currentto be 
 measured in the conductor serves as the primary of one 
turncoil. Itinduces a currentinthe secondary winding and 
 this current causes the meter to deflect.

 ea} 
 The core is so designed that there is only one breakin the 
magnetic path. The hinge and the opening both fit tightly 
 when the instrument closes around the conductor. The

Vhen the   core   is clamped around   a current-carrying 
conductor, the alternating magnetic field induced in the 
core, produces a current in the secondary winding. 
This current causes a deflection onthe scale of the meter 
movement. The current range can be changed by means of 
a range switch’, which changesthe taps onthe transformer

 Safety: The secondary winding of the current transformer 
should always   be either shunted or connected to the 
ammeter, otherwise, dangerous potential differences may 
occur across the open secondary. 
Before takingany measurement, make sure   the indication 
 is at zero on the scale.   If it is not,   reset by the zero- 
 adjustment screw. It is usually located near the bottom of 
the meter. 
Looping the conductor more than once through the core is 
another means of changing the range. If the current is far 
below the   meter''s   maximum   range,   we   can   loop the 
conductor through the core two or more times (Fig 6).

Smartmeters - Automatic meter reading   - Supply requirements 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   understand construction of smart meter 
*   explain the working of smart meter. 
 Smart Meter 
 Now a days smartmeters are usecito measure the electricity 
consumption of a building. Smart meters offer more detailed 
data than the old meters. They also give customers the 
updated power usage data. By this they control their power 
 usage. 
 Smart meters measures not only energy butalso measures 
voltage, frequency and KVA also. It delivers information 
wirelessly via low energy radio frequency waves to the 
competent authorities (EB). 
Automatic meter reading 
Automatic meter reading or AMR is the Technology of 
automatically collecting consumption,   diagonastic and 
status data from energymetering devices and transferring 
that data to   the   central   data   base   for   billing,   trouble 
shooting and analyzing. 
AMR   which   works   by   translating   the   movement   of 
mechanical dials ona meter into a digital signal, does not 
require physical access or visual   inspection 
An AMR meter works by creating a connection channel 
between a business customer and   its energy supplier. For 
an   AMR   meter the communicartion only goes   in   one 
direction, to the supplier. The energy supplier will receive 
meter reading once per month, so there is no need for 
manual reading. 
Smartmeters   works   by   using   a   secure   national 
communication   network.   Smartmeters   are   the   new 
generation of energy meters while AMR is an attached 
device that transmits the meter reading. 
The most note worthy advantages for using these system 
are   increased   efficiencies,   outage   detection,   tamper 
notificationand reduced labour cost, smart meters usually 
use wireless signals at 2.4GHZ witha maximum power of 
less than one watt. 
Thesmartmeters should have the following minimum basic 
features: 
*   Measurement of electrical energy parameters 
 *   Bidirectional communication 
 *   Integarated   load limiting switch relay 
*   Tampereventdeduction, recording and reporting 
«   Powereventalarm 
*   Remote firmware upgrade 
*   WNetmetering (kwh) features 
Electrical supply requirements of smart meter 
Forsmartmeters, selecting the appropriate power supplies 
is essential to ensure optimal safety standards and lower 
the chances of malfunctioning in field developments. For 
this reason the authorities should consider some of the 
power supply requirements for smart energy metering 
system   application.   Some   of the   factors   to   consider 
include the followig. 
*   60 - 230¥V Ac stable input 
*   Transient power of 6.72 VW 
*   EMI class B with surge voltage to (or) over 2KV 
(EMI - Electro magnetic interference) 
Detecting /clearing the tamper notification on meter 
Meter tampering means doing any act, which causes the 
meter to run slower or not at all and is basically theft of 
electricity fromthe authorities that supply electrical power. 
The tamper   notification (or) anti theft device is designed to 
detect the tamper inthe energy meter of residential areas 
and notifies it to the power company through SMS. 
The device detects the tampering through the reading of 
the to   current sensers that are connected to a micro 
controller. 
The power company will get notified, when one of the 
current sensors detects current, while the other one has 
not or there   is a difference from the reading of the to 
current sensors.   This systems also notifies the authority 
with an average time of 17.61 sec. Upon notification the 
power company immediately disconnect the line. 
To   detect   electricity   theft   in   an   area,   a   temperature 
dependent predictive model which uses smart meter data 
and data from distribution transformer. 
Distributed generation and prosumer 
Distributed   generation   (DG)   refers   to   a   variety   of 
technologies that generate electricity at (or)   near where   it 
will be Used such as solar panels and combined heat and 
power. Distributed generation is generation of electricity 
located in the distribution grid. 
A ‘prosumer’   is an individual who   both consumes and

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the function of the additional series resistance in a voltmeter 
*   calculate the value of the total resistance of the   meter with respect to voltage and full scale   deflection of 
current 
*   determine the resistance of a multiplier. 
Meter movement: A basic current meter movement by 
itself can be usedito measure voltage. Youknow that every 
meter coil has a fixed resistance, and, therefore, when 
current flows through   the   coil,   a voltage   drop will   be 
developed across this resistance.   According to Ohm''s 
Law, the voltage drop (E) will be proportional to the current 
flowing through the coil of resistance R (E = IR). 
For example, in Fig 1 you have a Q-1   milliampere meter 
movement with a coil resistance of   1000 ohms. When 1 
milliampere is flowing through the metercoil andis causing 
f.s.d. the voltage developed across the coil resistance will 
be

 SINCE THE VOLTAGE ACROSS THE METER COIL RESISTANCE 
IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH 
THE COIL, THE 1MA CURRENT METER MOVEMENT CAN 
MEASURE VOLTAGE DIRECTLY IN UNITS OF VOLTAGE. 
 ELN259711 
 E= [yg Ryq= 0.001 x 1000 = 1Volt 
 E =|,R,, =0.001x 1000   =1   volt. 
 If only   half that current (0.5   milliampere) was flowing 
through the coil, thenthe voltage across the coil would be: 
 E = |.R,,= 0.0005 x 1000 = 0.5 volt. 
 Itcanbeseenthat the voltage developed across the coilis 
proportional to the current flowing through the coil.   Also, 
the currentthat flows through the   coilis proportional to the 
voltage applied to the coil.   Therefore, by calibrating the 
meter scale in units of voltage instead of in units of current, 
the voltage in various parts of a circuit can be measured. 
Althougha current   meter movementinherently canmeasure 
voltage, its usefulness is limited because the current that 
the meter coilcan handle, as wellasits coil resistance, are 
very low.   For example, the maximum voltage you could 
measure with the 1   milliampere meter movement in the 
above example   is   1   volt.   In   actual   practice,   voltage 
measurements higher than 1 volt will be required.

 Multiplierresistors: Since a basiccurrent meter movement 
canonly measure very smallvoltages, The voltage range of 
ameter movement can be extended by adding a resistor, 
inseries.   The value ofthis resistor must be suchthat, when 
added to the meter coil resistance, the total resistance 
limits the current to the full-scale current rating of the meter 
forany applied voltage. 
Forexample, suppose one wanted to use the 1-milliampere, 
1000-ohms meter movement to measure voltages upto 10 
volts.   From   Ohm''s   Law,   it   can   be   seen   that,   if the 
movement   is   connected   across a   10-volt   source,   10 
milliamperes wouldflow through the   movementand would 
probably ruinthemeter (l= E/R =10/1000=10 milliamperes). 
But the meter current can be limited to 1 milliampere if a 
multiplier resistor (R,,,,,) ''sadded inseries withthe meter 
resistance (R,,).   Since a maximum of only 1 milliampere 
can flow through the meter, the total resistance of the 
multiplier resistor andthe meter (R_.=R,,.+,,) must 
limit the meter current to one milliampere. By Ohm''s Law, 
the total resistance is 
 Risr   = Eyed, = 10 volts/0.001 ampere 
 = 10,000 ohms. 
But this is the total   resistance   needed. Therefore,   the 
multiplier resistance is 
 Ryur=   Rror 7 Ry = 19000 - 1000 = 9000 ohms. 
 The basic 1-milliampere,   1000-ohms meter movement can 
now measure 0-10 volts, because 10 volts must be applied 
to cause a full-scale deflection. However, the meterscale 
must now be re-calibratedfrom 0-10 volts, or, ifthe previous 
scale is used all the reading should be multiplied by   10 (Fig 
 2).

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
 «   define shunt used in ammeter 
 *   calculate a shunt resistance to extend the range of an ammeter 
*   name the material used for shunt 
*   apply the use of terminals in standard shunts. 
Shunts:   Moving   coils   of basic   meters by themselves 
cannot carry large currents, since they are made of fine 
wire. To measure a current greater than that which the 
moving coil can carry, alow resistance, called a SHUNT, 
is connected across the instrument terminals (Fig 1).

 The shunt, therefore, makes it possible to measure cur- 
rents much greater than that could be measured by the 
basic meter alone. 
The shunt equation: A meter and shunt combination is 
identical to the parallel circuit shown in Fig 2. Instead of 
labelling the top resistor R,,, it can be labeled R,,, which 
represents the resistance of the moving coil. Resistor R, 
 can be labelled R.,, te represent the resistance of the 
 shunt.   |.,   andl,, then becomel,,, andl,, to   indicate the 
current flow through the shunt andthrough the meter. This 
 means thatthe equation |.,R,   =I,,.R,cannow be written 
 BS   Rc   =   Ieee SH"   SH 
 Therefore, ifthree of these values are known, thefourthcan 
be calculated. Since the shunt resistance R., is always 
the unknown quantity, the basic equation 
 Ink 
 Tsu 
 =   R leggy   IR,   becomes   SH 
 Fromthis equation, shunts can be calculated to extendthe 
 range of a current meter to any value, 
 where   Rey, = shunt resistance 
ls,   = meter current 
 R,,   = resistance of moving coil instrument 
I, = current flow through shunt. 
The value of current through the shunt(|.,) is simply the 
difference between the total current youwant to measure, 
and the actual full-scale deflection of the meter. 
l,,=1-1,, where |= total current. 
 The meter and shunt act like R, and R, in parallel. So, 
Rsy   =   Suu.

Calculating shuntresistance: Assume thatthe range of 
a one milliampere   meter movement is to be extended to

 Calibration 
 Inmany industrial operations, measurement instruments 
must be trusted to provide the accuracy stipulated by the 
original design to assure a satisfactory product.   This 
confidence is provided by a periodic testing and adjustment 
ofthe instrument to verify the required performance. This 
type of maintenance Is called calibration. 
Standards 
Before calibrationcan begin, youmust havethe accurately 
known values of the measured quantities against whichto 
compare the measurements made by the instrument being 
calibrated.   Thus, for an instrument that is supposed to 
measure current of 1   milli ampere, you must have, for 
comparison, a source of current that is known to within at 
least that range or better.   Only then you can say whether 
the instrument performs satisfactorily. 
Avery accurately known quantity used for calibration of 
instruments is known as a standard. 
 Calibration standards

 Voltage   Standard cell, high precision

thermometers. 
Calibrating DC and AC meters (Ammeter & Voltmeter) 
Both DC and AC meters are calibrated in essentially the 
same way.   To calibrate   a DC meter, a very accurate DC 
current source is connected tothe meter. The output ofthe 
currentsource must be variable, andsome means must be 
available to monitor the output current ofthe source. Many 
sources have built-in meter for this purpose. 
The output of the current source is varied in very small 
steps,   and at each step the   scale of the   meter being 
calibrated is marked to correspond to the reading onthe 
monitoring device.   This procedure is continued until the 
entire scale of the meter is calibrated. 
Same procedure is used to calibrate an AC meter, except 
that a 50/60 cps sine wave is used mostly. Also, you know 
that an a-c meter reads the average value of asine wave, 
but it is desirable for the meter to indicate rms values. 
Thereforethe rms equivalentare calculated andmarkedon 
the scale. 
Thermocouple meters are calibrated onthe basisof asine 
wave. Butthe calibrationis made atthe frequency at which 
the meter willbe used. At the extremely high frequencies 
at which it is used,   a phenomenon known as skin effect 
 occurs. 
 At these frequencies, the current in a wire travels at the

Precautions to be observed when using an ammeter 
in measurement work 
1   Never connect an ammeter across a source of EMF. 
Because of its low resistance it would draw damaging 
high currents and damage the delicate   movement. 
Always connect an   ammeter in series with   a   load 
capable of limiting the current. 
2   Observe the correct polarity.   Reverse polarity causes 
the meter to deflect against the mechanical stop and 
this may damage the pointer.

 Loading   effect   of   voltmeter and voltage drop effect of ammeter in circuits 
 Objectives: At the end of the lesson you shall be able to 
¢   define the term ‘multiplier’ 
*   analyse the loading effect of the voltmeter 
*   analyse the effect of voltage drop across the ammeter in the resistance measurement. 
Multipiler 
Inthe caseofP.M.M.C. instruments, we have seen thatthe 
moving coil consists offine gauge copperwire. This copper 
wire cancarry very low currentinthe order of millior micro 
amperes only. 
The acceptable current which enables the instrument to 
read full scale is called full scale deflection current or 
F.S.D. current. WvhensuchaP.M.M.C. instrumentis to be 
converted   as a voltmeter,   the   moving   coil   has to   be 
connected with a high resistance in series so that the 
current could be restricted withinthe F.S.D. current value. 
This series resistance is called multiplier resistance. 
Let us stucly how the voltmeter sensitivity causes loading 
effect in the circuit by the voltmeter. 
Loading   effect of a   voltmeter:   The   sensitivity of a 
 voltmeterisan important factor when selecting a meter 
 for a certain voltage measurement.   Alow sensitivity 
voltmeter may give an almost correct reading when 
measuring voltages in low-resistance circuits, butitis 
certain to produce very high errors in high resistance 
circuits.   It is due to the fact that the voltmeter, when 
connected across a high resistance circuit, acts asa shunt 
forthat portion ofthe circuit, and, thereby,   reduces the 
equivalent resistance in that portion   of the circuit. 
As such, the meter will then give a lower indication of 
the voltage drop than what actually existed before the 
meter was connected.   This effect is called the loading 
effect ofa voltmeter and   itis caused principally by the low 
sensitivity of the voltmeter. 
The meter with the higher sensitivity of onms/volt rating 
gives the most reliable result.   Itis important to realize the 
factor ofsensitivity, particularly when voltage measurements 
are made in high-resistance circuits.   Hence the following 
points are required to be followed while using a voltmeter. 
«   When using a multi-range voltmeter, always use the 
highest voltage range, and then decrease the range 
until   a good   up-scalé   (above   mid-scale) reading is 
obtained. 
*   Always be aware ofthe loading effect. This effect can 
be minimised by using a voltmeter of high sensitivity 
and highest range in voltmeter. 
*   Before reading the meter, try to select a range in the 
multi-scale instrument such thatthe reading obtained is 
above mid-scale.   The precision of   the measurement 
decreases if the indication is at the low end of the scale. 
Effect of voltagedrop across theammeter in resistance 
measurement:   The   ammeter/voltmeter   method   of 
measuring resistance is very popular since the instrument 
required for this is usually available in the laboratory. 
 In this method, two types of connections of meters are 
 possible (Figs 1a and b).

 The measured value ofresistanceR,   would be equaltothe 
truevalueR   provided the ammeter resistance is zero and 
the voltmeter resistance   is infinite, to   rake the   circuit 
condition undisturbed. 
However, in practice this isnot possible, andhence, both 
 the methods qve   inaccurate   results.   But the   error in

Circuit(Fig 1a): Inthis circuit, the arnmeter measures thetrue 
value of the currentthrough the resistor.   Butithe voltmeter 
does notread the truevoltage acrosstheresistance. On 
the other hand the voltmeter measuresthe voltage drop 
across the resistance and also the ammeter.

 From equation 2, itis clear that the measured value of

 Conclusion: From equation 3, itis clear that the errarin 
measurement would   be   small if the value of resistance 
 under measuramentis large as compared to the internal 
 resistance of the ammeter. Therefore the circuit   shownin 
 Fig lial is most suitable for measuring high resistance

Circuit(Fig 1b): inthis circuitthe voltmeter measures the 
true value of   the voltage across the   resistance but the 
ammeter measures   the sum   of currents   through the
