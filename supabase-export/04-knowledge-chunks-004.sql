 While connecting the incoming and outgoing 
cables to the MCB and D.B. they should pass 
through the holes in the top board and then 
through   the   holes   provided   in   the top   and 
bottom sides of the base board. 
In both cases sufficient allowance of length 
should   be given   in the cables such that the 
hinged top board could be opened at an angle 
of 120° fromthe base board. Harnessing of the 
cables inside the board should be done with 
the P.V.C. cable clips, and the cables should 
pass in or out from the MCB and D.B. through 
Individual circuit loads have to be indicated in 
amperes by fixing labels on the D.B 
 the P.V.C. bushed holes. 
 Interconnect the MCB and DB as shown in Fig 4.

 MOUNTING GUTTY IN THE RECESS   GUTTY  ELN237BH3 
 Smoothenthe surface of the wallwitha   mason''s trowel. 
 Allowthecementto dryfor 4 hours and sprinkle 
water on the cement every one hour so that the 
cement settles. The gutties become rigid after 
approximately 24 hours. Then only the boards 
could be fixed on to the gutties. 
Now the wall is ready for fixing the T.VV. board. 
Fix the T.VV. board with the help of 45mm long wood 
 Screws. 
 Trainees arerequired to identify the relationship 
between   the   stem thickness   of   45mm   long 
wood screws and the respective designation 
numbers. 
TASK 2: Preparation of wall for drawing the service connection 
Sometimes the service connection wires need 
tobetaken   through the wall using aG.I. pipe. 
There is then the necessity of making a hole 
through the wall with the help of a pipe jumper. 
The method to do it is as explained below. The 
diameter of the pipe jumper depends on the 
diameter of the service connection pipe and 
the length ofthe pipe jumper depends upon the 
wall thickness. 
1   Takea20mmdia. G.I. pipe of 400mm length. 
2   Make serrations by cutting at one end of the pipe as 
shown in Fig 3 using a hacksaw.

 PIPE JUMPER  ELNZ87BH4 
 This   type of pipe jumper   is also called   crown 
jumper, due to its very look. 
3   Inspectthe wallandmarka place onthe wall considering 
the nearest point to the electric service pole. 
The   marking   should   be   close to   the   meter 
terminals. Itshould not beontheR.C. .beamor 
granite stone embedded in the wall. 
In the case of an old building check whether 
any concealed wiring is running through the 
wall at the place of marking. In such cases the 
marking should be done at a different place. 
However,   in   buildings,   where wiring   exists, 
switch off the mains, remove the fuse-carrier 
and keep it under your custody. 
 A 
 cS) 
Keep the pipe jumper onthe markandhammer itlightly. 
Rotate the pipe jumper for every stroke of hammer. 
This   process removes the broken masonory 
and allows free movement of the pipe jumper. 
Take   care   to   keep   the   pipe   jumper 
perpendicular to the wall surface. 
Slow down the hammer strokes when the pipe jumper 
reaches near to the other end of the wall. 
Hitting hard on the hammer at the end of ahole 
will make a larger sized plaster to fall out at the 
 other end of wall. 
 Clear the hole. 
 Insertthe G.I. pipe forthe service cable inthe hole and 
plaster around the pipe with cement. 
Wiring up a meter board 
Confirm the capacity of the energy meter. 
Selectandconfirmthe size ofthe cable as per the meter 
rating. 
Follow the standard colour code for phase and 
neutral. 
Position the meter, |.C. cut-out and earth-plate as per 
layout (Fig 4) and mark   their position as per layout on 
the T.W. board. 
Mark the cable entry positions and mounting screw 
positions. 
Select the drill bit according to the cable size. 
Drillthrough holes inthe TW. board for cable entry and 
pilotholes forfixing the meter, |.C. cutoutandthe earth 
plate. 
Fix the meter, |.C. cut out and the earth plate.

above load as per IE rules. 
Indian   electricity rule states that there should 
be separate sub circuits for light/fan loads and 
power   loads.   Therefore   6A   plug   points 
(Sockets)   are considered as   light / fan load 
points as they are meant for connecting table 
fan   /table   lamp   etc.   16A   power   plug   are 
considered as power points as they are used 
forconnecting heavy loads like heaters, kettles 
etc. 
Total wattage of light points   =8x60= 480W 
Total   wattage of fan points   =5x80= 400W 
Total wattage of (6A) sockets   =4x 80 = 320 W 
 Totall7 Nos   =   1200 W 
 As there are 1/7 points, we need two sub - circuits. The 
division of outlets on each sub circuit is made more or 
less uniform, ie.,   8&9. Refer Fig 2

 4   Check one circuit at a time and then proceed step by 
step. 
5   Checkthe circuits having? way switches, the concerned 
switches may be operated alternately to ensure the 
correct test result. 
6   Checkthe defective fan, regulators or lamps by shorting 
the suspected appliance if necessary and then retest 
 it. 
 Short circuit fault 
1   Make the circuit as shown in Fig 2 and connect the 
megger,   if it shows continuity in both ON and OFF 
positions of the switch, this indicates short in circuit. 
For   open circuit fault   removal of   fuses, etc 
are to be done before doing the test by using

3   Check circuit fuses whether in order or not,   if not, 
rewire the fuses. 
 2   Checkinsulationresistance between the cables of the 
 installation and earth. 
3   Connect the megger terminal   ''E’ to the live wire and L 
to the corresponding   neutral wire, the   megger will

21   Enter the value of the earth electrode resistance in 
Column   5 of Table 1. Fill   up the other particulars also. 
The acceptable value of the earthelectrode resistance 
has been given earlier. Check the value if it. 
22   Checkthe value ofthe earth resistance is found higher 
than the acceptable value, make one more pipe earth 
electrode at adistance of 8 metres fromthe earlier one 
and connect beth of them in parallel. 
 23   Measure   the   earth   electrode   value   and   enter   it   in 
Column 6 of Table 1. 
 The second reading with two electrodes will 
be approximately half the first reading which 
was taken with one electrode. The measured 
value   should   be   within   the   recommended 
value.

 ELNZ488H5  TESTING THE TUBE 
 7   Test the tube light assembly for its working. 
TASK 2 : Installation of tube light fitting 
1   Follow   the   recommended   method   and   procedure 
depending onthe type of   wiring. 
The fixing of the tube to the wall, ceiling or 
tubular postshould bestrong enoughto support 
the weight of the fitting. 
The installed fitting must be below the   level of 
the ceiling fan to avoid the flickering effect of 
 the shadow. 
 Check the supply at the ceiling rose. Switch off 
the supply before making any connection. 
2   Connect the tube light fitting to the ceiling rose. 
Fix the fluorescent tube in the fitting. 
Use a stable ladder and a helper to   hold the 
ladder while you are working on the ladder. 
Switch “ON'' the supply and observe the glow of the 
tube.   If the   tube   is   not   glowing,   check for   proper 
housing of starter and tube. 
TASK 3: Install and test the H.P.M.V (High Pressure Mercury Vapour) lamp with accessories 
1   Readthe specification ofthe   mercury vapour lamp and 
the choke from the markings. (Fig 8) 
2   Connect the H.P.M.V.   lamp in series with the 60W 
240V bulband test in240V AC supply.   Check whether 
the series test lamp glows. 
3   Test the choke for its working condition. 
4   Assemblethe accessories (choke, holderandcapacitor) in 
the fitting, followingthe manufacturer''s instructions. 
5   Connect the accessories as per circuit diagram, Fig 7 
(Pictorial diagram Fig 8) usingthe recommendedtype 
oftermination. 
Choosethetapping of the choke suitable to the 
rated supply system voltage. 
6   Fix the bulb inthe holder and test the working of the 
lamp with the supply voltage. 
Ensure the fitting   is   properly earthed at the 
earthing terminal provided, before testing. 
A modern M.V. lamp with a built-in resistor needs no 
external accessories to be connected as discussed 
above. I{tcan be connected as we do anincandescent 
lamp. 
Installation of the MV   lamp fitting 
 8   Assemble, connectandtestthe M.V. lampfitting onatable, 
forits working. Then remove the cover and bulb.
