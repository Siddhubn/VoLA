 8   Hold the cable end (that is without the binding) in one 
 hand and twist the strands of the other cable end over 
 it, one by one, closely and tightly. Each strand has to 
be twisted half a turn at a time. 
The direction of twist to form the shoulder 
 should be the same as that of the cable twist.

 ELN13285  TINNING CABLE END 
 A thin coating of tinshould be on the stranded 
cable end. 
9   Apply asmall quantity of flux inside the lug socket. Tin 
the lug by melting the solder stick to fillthe socket and 
pour the molten solder in the tray. 
Pouring   out the   molten   solder from the   lug 
socket a couple of times will make the tinning 
perfect. 
10 Apply some flux to the cable end and the interior of the 
socket. 
11   Fill the socket of the lug with molten solder. (Fig 6)

 13 Remove the blowlamp and firmliy hold the cable and 
socket without shaking. 
14 Remove the extra solder from the lug and cable by 
wiping it with a piece of cotton cloth while the solder is 
 still hot. 
 15 Keep on holding the cable and lugasin Fig? andallow 
the solder to solidity. 
Do   not   use water to   cool   the   lug.   This will 
crystallize the solder and make it weak.

 PROCEDURE 
 TASK 1: Make straight joint using sleeves in U.G cable 
1   Cut the given cable into two pieces asin Fig 1.   Fig 1 
Fig 2 is given here for your guidance. Actual 
measurement for the cable insulation removal 
depends upon the type of cable joint box and 
cable sealing compound. Conventional method 
of cable jointing   is done with   bitumen   com- 
pound for sealing the joint , brass glands atthe 
ends of the joint box for sealing the joint entry 
and plumbing to finish the job. Modern joints 
with epoxy compounds   aredone by sealing the 
joint entry either with   special tapes   or with 
special compounds. According to the method 
chosen, the measurement has to be made and 
the insulation has to be removed at specified 
points.   For   procedural   convenience   in   this 
sheet, L, is taken as 200 mm and so on.   3   Remove the armour and serving of the cables to a 
length of 200 mmfrom the end of each cable as shown 
in Fig 4. 
 ELN13314 
 2   Bind 16 SWG GI binding wire on the serving (PILC 
cable) of the cables at a distance of 210 mm from one

16 See that the ladles are dry and then start alternately 
scooping the molten solder with the lacles till the ladles 
are sufficiently hot. 
17 Keep one of the empty ladles underneath the split 
sleeve that has to be soldered.

 19 Stop pouring the solderwhenthe sleeve is filled up, and 
the colour of the solder is bright. 
20 Repeat this procedure to other joints one after another. 
Do   not shake or disturb the position of the 
cables during the soldering process as it will 
result in dry joints. 
21   After the joint is cold, wrap with at least 2 layers of 
impregnated PVC tape over the joints. 
22 Preheatthe joint box before filling the preheated sealing 
compound. 
23 Close the top and bottomparts of the joint box together 
and, position the brass glands. 
24 Use the solder lead to make proper plumbing joints 
between the lead sheath and the brass gland.

 When the compound is filled   up to the mouth of 
the inlet, stop pouring and allow it to cool. 
After sufficient   cooling,   the   compound   will 
shrink, and now fill the available space with 
more molten compound. 
After the joint is sufficiently heated, increase 
the time between the   pourings   to   allow the 
solder to solidify inside the joint. 
26 Fix the cover inlet of the joint box after the joint is 
sufficiently cooled.

 PROCEDURE 
 TASK 1: Locate open circuit faults in underground cable 
This test is made to check whether the cable 
insulation   is in open condition and to identify 
the exact location of the open circuit. 
Switch ''OFF'' the mains.   Remove the fuse and the 
neutral links inthe main switch and keep them in safe 
custody. 
Select 500 V Megger and connect one terminal of the 
Megger, say L, to the one end of cable as shown in 
 Fig 1. 
 Fig 1   
CONDUIT OR LEAD 
SHEATHING 
 ELN1333U1 
 3   Connect the other terminal of the Megger say ‘E’ to 
the other end of the cable. 
Rotate the megger at 160 r.p.m. 
Observe the megger reading.   If the megger shows 
infinity, there is open circuit in the cable. 
Open circuit may be due to open in the cable. 
If the megger shows ‘0’ reading, it indicates no 
open in the cable. 
Connect the ‘E’ terminal near the middle of the cable 
and repeat the above procedure for open circuit. 
 If it shows   ‘0’ reading, there is no open   in 
 between ‘L’ and the middle of the cable. 
Repeat the   above   procedure,   connecting the   ‘E’ 
terminal to beyond the middle point of the cable at 
varied distances. 
When the megger shows infinity in a parhcilar 
place, that is the point of open. 
Locate the faulty portion and make fresh straight joint 
to the UG cable. 
 TASK 2: Locate the short circuit fault in U.G cable 
 This test is madetolocate the short circuitin the 
cable by Murray loop test.

 Note:   All voltages are with respect to ground. 
 3   Enter the   calculated   values   in   the   first column   of 
Table 1 under the heading   “Fault conditions’. 
Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each resistor in turn. 
Consider now removing R,, calculate and record the 
resulting voltages at A,   Band C. 
Enter the calculated values in the fourth column of 
Table 1   under the heading   “Fault conditions’. 
Repeat this for each resistor in turn. 
Note:   Only one fault is simulated. 
Verify your calculations in steps 3 and 6 by connecting 
a piece of wire across each resistor in turn, simulating 
a short circuit across that resistor, and then removing 
each resistor, simulating an open at the location. 
 10 Measure voltage for each fault condition and be sure to 
 check consistency with the calculated values. 
11   Record   all   measured   data   in   the   corresponding 
 columns of Table 1.

 Check the battery for its condition. 
Check the values of the ratio arm. 
 Check the minimum and maximum values of   the vari- 
able resistance. 
Connect the unknown resister across terminals x and 
 XX. 
Set the   ratio arm to the approximate value of the 
unknown resistor. 
9   Close   the   switch   and   watch the   deflection   of the 
galvanometer. 
10 Adjust the variable arm by closing the switch, to geta 
minimum deflection inthe galvanometer. (In case the 
galvanometer needle overshoots, resetthe ratio arm.) 
11   Increase the sensitivity and repeat step 10. 
12 When Null deflection is achieved inthe galvanometer, 
note the value of the ratio arm and position ofthe variable 
resistance. Enter the values in Table 1. 
13 Apply the   formula   given   below   and   calculate   the 
resistance. 
 Unknown resistance in ohms = 
 Reading   of ratio arm setting   Xx   value of variable 
resistance 
 14 Enter the values in Table 1. 
 15 Repeatthe procedure for measuringatleastfour unknown 
resistors and enter their respective values in Table 1. 
16 Get the work approved by the instructor.

 3   Keep the potential divider point C at B. 
4   Close the switch and adjust the potential divider for 
current. (Approximately. 1 ampere. } 
Observe the ammeter reading. 
Touch the resistance wire and feel. 
Conclusion 
When   the   current   flows   in   a   resistive   wire 
isgenerated. 
8   Gradually increase the current by varying the potential 
 divider. 
 Note:   For every change   in   current value - 
switch OFF and allow the wire to cool down to 
the room temperature. 
For every change of current, the time duration 
to   feel   the   heat   must   be   the   same,   say   5 
minutes. 
9   Observethe valueofthe currentthrough the resistance 
wire. 
Note:   Feel   the   heat   at   a   distance without 
touching the wire.   Be cautious notte burn your 
fingers. 
 10 Conclusion 
When current increases

 PROCEDURE 
 Use the solenoid, used in exercise 1.4.39 and 
1.4.40. 
Take the two ends of the coil, solenoid and check its 
continuity. 
Wrap the tape over the solenoid. 
Wind the copper wire (22 SWG) overthe solenoidfrom 
one endo the halfthe length of the coil   and wrapit with 
the tape. 
Take the twoterminals of the copper wire and check its 
continuity. 
Fixthe solenoid, which already has two windings in the 
board using clamps and screws as shown in Fig 1. 
Connect 0 -10V MI voltmeter between two ends of 
copper wire. 
7   Apply AC 10V¥ to the solenoid (primary) and measure 
voltage between two ends of copper wire as shownin 
 Fig 1. 
 8   Note down the reading of the voltmeter in table 1. 
9   Insert the soft iron core into the solenoid.   Now the 
voltage willincrease. Note down the voltage in Table 1. 
10 Switch OFF andinserta non-magnetic cylindrical core 
inside the coil.   Switch ON the   10V supply. Note down 
the voltage in Table 1. 
11   Switch CFF and tabulate all the readings. 
12 Get the work approved by the instructor. 
13 Note down the result and conclusions.

Record the time and voltage in Table 2. 
Repeat steps 1 to 5 by changing the value of the series 
resistor ‘R’ (increasing the value of R increases the 
time).

for 5 minutes. 
 9   Result 
 The voltage across the capacitor remains 
because of   condition of the capacitor. 
10 Close the switch S to   position   2   and   observe the 
voltmeter andammeter   readings. 
11   Observe the deflection of the voltmeter: 
(a)   The voltage of the capacitor gradually decreases. 
(b   The   current shoots   to   maximum at the   instant 
switch S   is closed to position 2, then it decreases 
gradually,   indicating that the capacitor is losing 
charge. 
12 Repeatthe test for different values of capacitance rated 
for different voltages. 
The testing   voltage   should   be close to   the 
voltage rating of the capacitor.
