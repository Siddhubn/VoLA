 4   Close the switch; gradually increase the DC voltage 
until full scale deflection is acheved in M, (voltmeter 
under test). 
3   Record the reading of M, and then the voltage drop 
across M, at full scale deflection in Table 1. 
Open the switch and disconnect the circuit. 
Calculate the M C resistance of M, using Ohm''s Law 
and record in Table 1.

Increase the output of the PSU slowly tillthe standard 
ammeter (4) read S00   mA (full scale value of the 
ammeter under calibration (A,). 
6   Adjustthe rheostat such thatthe standard ammeter(A,) 
reads 450 mA (decrease in current equivalentto 110 
ofthe fullrange of the meter under calibration), 
6   Record the corresponding reading on the ammeter (AT) 
under calibration in Table 5. 
*   From the readings of the standard meter and the 
reading shown by the meter under calibration find the 
% of error in the meter under calibration   using the 
formula given in Table 4, 
5   Repeat step So   and? forthe values given in Table 3 
to cover the complete range of the ammeter under 
calibration. 
 9   Fromthe % errorfound at different readings, calculate 
 and record the average % error of the meter under 
 calibration.

 PROCEDURE 
 Adjustment of errors inside the energy meter is beyond the scope of this course as it requires costly 
equipment like rotating sub-standard meter etc. Hence the simplified method of finding errors only is 
included   here. 
TASK 1: Check the energy meter at no load (to find the creeping error) 
1   Connect the energy meter through an auto-transformer 
as shown in Fig 1. 
2   Vary the input voltage to the energy meter between 
80% and 110% of the rated voltage of the energy meter.

 For an energy meter rating of 240 Volts the input 
voltage is between 192 V to 264 V. Observe, if 
the meter disc is rotating or not. The load should 
not be connected or the load   switch should 
be ‘off’ during the observation period. 
3   Write your observations correlating your findings from 
the above experiments with the recommendation given 
 in IS 722. 
OBSERVATION 
 As per IS 722 (Part |) 1977 the meter shall not 
make a complete revolution   at any voltage 
between   80%   and   110%   of the   reference 
TASK 2: Task for starting current error in energy meter 
voltage. 
1   Connect low load (5 W lamp) as shown in Fig 2. 
 2   Switch on the load and observe the meter rotation.

 Repeat the working steps from 2 to 8 for 50%, 75%, 
100%   resistive and   inductive   loads   and   enter   in 
 Table 1. 
 For inductive load,   make the connection as 
shown in Fig 4. 
For checking the proper registraion of energy, 
verify the readings through   initial   and final 
reading differences   recorded   in   the energy 
meter.   As   per   I.S.   722   (Part   Ill}   1977, the 
percentage error shall not exceed £2%, both 
at unity power factor and at 0.5 lagging. 
If the above errors are beyond the limitation 
prescribed   in   |.S., take action for calibration 
of the   energy   meter   at   the   meter testing 
department attached to the electricity board.

 Improve the insulation value by heating or varnishing, if 
the insulation value is less than one megohm and enter 
the test results in the maintenance card. (Table 2) 
If the motor is opened for varnishing, clean thoroughly 
the stator and armature and bush bearings. (Fig 2) 
Conduct the insulation test after varnishing and enter 
the results inthe maintenance card (Table 2). 
Remember that the nuts at the blades and the 
centre shaft holding nut are to be loosened by 
clockwise movement and tightened   by anti- 
clockwise movement in most of the mixers. 
10 Lubricate the bearing as recommended by the manu- 
facturer before assembly. 
Most of the bearings   need   no lubrication.   If 
required,a drop of light oil like 3-in-1 oil could 
be used.

 could be removed by CTC. Seat the bushes properly 
over the commutator. Check for adequate length of 
brushes to exert spring pressure. 
Ifthe brush length is shorter by 1/3 of   its original 
length it is better to replace with the brushes 
of the same grade and size. The new brush 
has to be bedded on the commutator properly. 
12 Assemble the motor and tighten the terminal screws. 
13 Assemble the blade with the jar and nylon coupling at 
 the bottom.

1   Read the instruction manual of the washing machine.   6 
2   Connect the machine to the supply and switch on the 
machine   in   steps   as   indicated   by the   operating/ 
instruction manual.   7 
3   Check the water flow at the inlet to the machine.   If 
found incorrect clean the inlet and reconnect the water 
supply using proper waterproofing method. If leakage   2 
is present at the connecting point between the machine 
and the water   pipe,   use teflon tape   between the 
couplings to prevent leakage. 
4   Check the water flow at the outlet and   check whether 
all the water is drained out of the wash drum. If it does 
not, disconnect the machine from the supply then level 
the machine on the floor and let the water is drained   9 
out. 
5   Isolate   the   machine   from   the   supply.   Gpen   the 
inspection cover of the machine and carry out visual 
inspection of : 
Lubricate the bearings of the motor with a suitable 
grease as recommended by the manufacturer with the 
help of the grease pump. 
and especially where   maximum vibration   of the 
machines is felt,   use a dot of grease or oil   in the 
threads. 
Conduct an insulation test of the motor and record it 
in Table 3, usinga SO0V Megger. Insulation resistance 
should be around 1 megohm; if found less then check 
the wiring and internal accessories and all Powerly live 
parts for moisture and weak insulation. Remove the 
moisture and prevent any water leakage near the Power 
parts suitably. Reconduct the insulation test. 
Close the inspection   hatch/cover and connect the 
 machine to the supply and load the machine with the 
 number of clothes recommended by the manufacturer 
for the smooth running of the washig machine.

 Mark HT terminals as A, and Py: Mark at LT terminals 
 as a,anda,. 
 Press the push-button switch. Observe the deflection 
of the pointer of the voltmeter. If the pointer deflects in 
the   right direction,   retain the   markings   made on 
terminals. 
Change   the voltmeter connections   made   to   LT 
terminals and change the marking made on the LT 
terminals if the deflection is in the reverse direction.

 Ensure that the auto-transformer is initially set 
at zero volt output position. 
 Close the switch ‘S’. 
 From the above data the No load loss is equal 
to iron loss. Since the copper loss is negligible. 
TASK 2: Conduct shot circuit test to determine full load copper loss of a transformer 
 Short circuit test

Connect the auto-transformer, ammeters, voltmeter 
and wattmeter in the HT side of the transformer as 
shown in Fig 2. 
The   secondary   is   short   circuited   by the 
ammeter. 
Ensure the auto-transformer is initially set at 
zero volt output position. 
 Close the switch ‘S’ 
 Increase the voltage gradually to obtain full load current 
inthe secondary winding of the transformer.

 After sparking the oil nearthe electrode will turn black 
in colour. 
12 Repeat the steps 5 to 11 with oil in the second sample. 
Note that the breakdown voltage of the first 
and second samples should be approximately 
 equal. 
 13 Prepare the test for the third sample. 
14 Conduct the test by increasing the test voltage up 40 
 KV. 
 15 Apply the test voltage for about one minute and observe 
that there is no sparking. 
Note that good oil should withstand 40 kV for one 
minute. 
 Conclusion 
 5   Fill the cup with a sample of cil to be tested   1   cm 
above the electrodes or the marked level on the cup. 
6   Close the cup witha clean cover and allow 5 minutes 
for the oil to settle so that all air bubbles may disappear. 
 7   Make sure that the test area is clear of all the other 
 persons. 
8   Setvoltage regulation at zero position. 
9   Switch ‘ON’ the supply. 
10 Raise the voltage gradually from zero so that the full 
voltage is reached within 20 to 30 seconds. 
It is quite possible that a spark may occur ata 
very early stage i.e even 20 kV due to some 
extraneous matter like microscopic strands of 
cotton, dust etc. which have a tendency to get 
aligned along the strong electrostatic field in 
the spark gap. It may burn out and may not 
affect the test. 
Since the water is heavier than oil, it settles 
down at the bottom of the tank. 
16   If the tested oil is in good condition, fill this oil in the
