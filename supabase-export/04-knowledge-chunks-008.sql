The average power ina circuit containing only a capacitance 
iszero. This may be shown by plottingthe power curve from 
the current and voltage curves (Fig   11) as was done fora 
circuit with the inductance only.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the voltage and current relationship 
*   determine impedance of a series circuit with RL in series 
*   calculate power in a series circuit (with RL in series) 
*   calculate the power factor in RL series circuit. 
When resistance and inductance are connectedinseries, 
 or inthe case of acoil with resistance, the rms current |, 
 islimited by both X,, and R however the current | isthe same 
inX, andR   since they are in series, the voltage dropacross 
 Ris V,= IR andthe voltage drop across X is V,   =I. The 
 current! through X, mustlag V, by 90° because this is the 
phase angle between current through an inductance and 
its self-induced voltage. The current! through R,andits IR 
voltage drop,are in phase and so the phase angle is 0°. 
Now let us apply the principle of phasor representation to 
a   series   circuit   containing   pure   resistance   and   pure 
inductance. (Fig 1) 
 Fig 1 
 ELN165351  CIRCUIT WITH R & LIN SERIES 
 Since we are considering a series circuit, itis convenient 
if we draw the current phasor in the horizontal reference 
position because it is “common to both the resistor and 
inductor. Superimposed upon this phasor is the voltage 
phasor acrossthe resistor V_. This is because the current 
and voltage are always in phase with each other ina pure 
resistor. (Fig 2) 
 Fig2

VECTOR DIAGRAM OF R & L SERIES CIRCUIT  ELN1 65352 
 Similarly, the voltage phasor across the inductor V, is 
drawn 90° ahead ofthe current |inother words leading the 
current phasor. This is because, as we know, the current 
always lags the inductor voltage by 90° ina pure inductance. 
However, these two voltages are 90° outof phase with each 
other. This means that the total voltage across the series 
combination cannot be obtained simply by adding V..to V, 
algebraically. We musttake into account the angle between 
them. 
The applied voltage Vis the (phasor) sumofV,andV, with 
the phase angle added. 
This   phasor   addition   can   be   carried   out   simply   by 
constructing a parallelogram (a square in this case) and 
drawing the diagonal. This is shown in Fig 3. Clearly, the 
phasor sum V is less than the algebraic sum of V, and V.,. 
Also,   because V   is the   hypotenuse   of a   right-angled 
triangle, V is given by 
 Fig 3   Vv,

 Impedance of aseries RL circuit: The total opposition to 
current ina series, RL circuit, is called the impedance 7. 
It is the ratio of the total applied voltage V to the current I. 
Impedance is measured in chms as are resistance and 
inductive   reactance.   But,   as   shown   by the following, 
impedance is the vector sumof resistance andreactance. 
Consider the ‘voltage triangle’ for a series, RL circuit, as 
shown in Fig 4. 
Given   V°=V.7+V   2 and V, = IR and V, = |X,

Since the currentandvoltage are in phase, the phase angle 
is Zero and the power factor   is unity. Therefore, the power 
can be calculated with voltage and current itself. 
Power in pure inductance: If an AC circuit contains only 
 inductance, the voltage and current are 90° out of phase, 
 and the circuit of the instantaneous values of voltage and 
current gives with positive and negative power. Net result 
is the power consumed in a pure inductive circuit is zero. 
Power in pure capacitance: If an AC circuit contains 
only capacitor, the voltage and current are 90°.   Out of 
phase and the product of instantaneous values of voltage 
and current gives both positive and negative power.   Net 
resultis the power consumedina pure capacitive circuitis 
 zero. 
 R - C Series circuit 
 Most industrial installations have a lagging PF because of 
the large number of AC induction motors thatare inherently 
inductive. 
Effect of a low power factor 
For agiven quantity of true power ifthe power   factor ofthe 
load is less than unity it requires a highercurrentto deliver. 
This higher current means that more energy is wasted in 
the feeder wires serving the motor. Infact, if an industrial 
installation has a power factor lessthan 85% (0.85) overall, 
a   power factor penalty’ is assessed by the electric utility 
company. Itis for this reason that power factor correction 
is necessary in large installations. 
Power factor correction:   In order to make the most 
efficient use of the current delivered to a load we desirea 
high PF ora PF that approaches unity. 
A low PF is generally due to the large induction loads such 
 as discharge lamps, induction motors, transformers etc. 
 which take a lagging current and produce heat which 
returns to the generating station without doing any useful 
work as such it is essential to improve orcorrectthe low PF 
so as to bring the current as closely in phase with the 
voltage as possible. That is the phase angle 6 is made as 
small   as   possible.   This   is   usually done   by   placing   a 
capacitor load which produces a leading current. 
The capacitor   is to   be connected   in   parallel   with the 
inductive load. 
Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state   the   effect   of frequency on capacitive reactance in R-C series circuit 
*   calculate power factor 
*   determine the power factor and phase angle 
*   state the R-C time constant while charging and discharging.

 Therefore the   increase   in frequency (f)   results in the 
increase of the circuit current in the capacitive circuit. When 
resistance (R), capacitance (C) and frequency f are known 
in a circuit, the power factor cos 6 can be determined as 
follows. (Fig 1}

Resistance,   Inductance   and   capacitance   in   series 
(Fig   1a) shows resistance R, inductive reactance XL and 
capacitive reactance Xc, are connected in series. The 
voltage across the circuit is E, the frequency is f and the 
current is I. 
As this is a series circuit, the current is the same in all 
parts of the circuit, and for convenience the current phasor 
| is laid off horizontally in the circuit phasor diagram. The 
voltage E   - IR across the résistance is in phase with the 
current arid drawn to scale along the current phasor. The 
voltage E   - IX   across the inductance is drawn at right 
 angles to the current and leading. The voltage E   = IX 
 across the capacitor is drawn at right angles to the current 
and lagging. 
The voltage across the inductance and that across the 
capacitance are in opposition Fig 1 (b) so that the resultant 
voltage of these two is their arithmetical difference.   In 
Fig(1b)IX is shown greater than IX therefore, is subtracted 
directly form IX . The line voltage Must be phasor sum of 
three voltages and is the hypotenuse of a right - angled 
triangle and is the hypotenuse of a right - angled triangle 
of which IR and IX - IX arethe sides. Therefore,

Voltage drop inL = IXL=5.99x628=37/6.17V 
Voltage drop in   C = |IXC = 5.99 x 32 = 191.68V. 
Resonance circuit: VVnen the value of X and X   are equal, 
the voltage drop across them will be equal and‘hence they 
cancel each other. The value of voltage drops   V   and V 
may   be   much   higher than the   applied voltage.   The 
impedance of the circuit will be equal to the resistance 
value. Full value of applied voltage appears across R and 
the current in the circuit is limited by the value of resistance 
only. Such circuits are used in electronic circuits like radio/ 
T¥ turning circuits. When X   =X   _ the   circuitis said to be 
in   resonance.   As current will be   maximum   in   series 
resonant circuits it is also called acceptor circuits. Fora 
known value of Land C   the frequency at which this occurs 
is   called as   resonant frequency.   This value can   be 
calculated as follows when x. = Xx.

 Note: Power factor angle is commonly denoted 
by Theta.   In   some   pages of this text   it is

 —   resistance   R   is   the   total   resistance   of   the   series 
circuit(internal resistance) in ohms, 
 —   xX, isthe inductive reactance in chms, and 
—   xX, is the total capacitive reactance in ohms. 
 Inthe circuitat Fig 1a, since the capacitive reactance(90Q) 
is largerthan inductive reactance(60Q2), the netreactance 
of the circuit will be capacitive. This is shown in Fig 1b. 
Note: If the capacitive reactance was smaller 
than inductive reactance the net reactance of 
the circuit would have been inductive. 
Allthough the unit ofmeasure of reactance andresistance 
is the same(ohms),   the impedance, 7 of the circuit is not 
given   by the simple addition of R, x, and X..   This is 
because, X   is +90° out of phase with R and X.is-90° out 
of phase with R. 
Hence the impedance Z of the circuit isthe phasor addition 
of the resistive and reactive components as shown by 
dotted lines inFig 1c. Therefore, Impedance Z of the circuit 
is given by, 
 Z=iR” 4 — XP 
 If X, were greater than X., then the absolute value of 
impedance Z   is will be, 
 Z =)R? 40%, Kel?

 Therefore, the voltage drop across the components will 
be 
V, = voltage drop across R=|.R   = 2x40 = 80 volts 
 V_ = voltage drop across L=|.X = 2x60 = 120 volts 
 V..= voltage drop across C = |.X.. = 2x90 = 180 volts. 
Since V, and V.. are of opposite polarity, the net reactive 
voltage V, is   = 180 - 120 = 60V as shown in Fig 2. 
Note that the applied voltage is not equal to the sum of 
voltage drops across reactive component X and resistive 
component. This is again because the voltage drops are 
not in phase. But the phasor sum of V. and V,, will be

Condition at which current through the RLC Series 
circuit is maximum 
From the formula, 
 2  Zs \R? +(X,-X,)°   itis clear that the total imped- 
 ance 7 of the circuit will become purely resistive when, 
reactance X, =X. 
 In this condition, the impedance Z of the circuit will not 
only be purely resistive but also minimum. 
 Since the reactance of Land C are frequency depencert, 
at some particular frequency say f,, the inductive reactance 
X, becomes equal to the capacitive reactance X.. Insuch 
a case, since the impedance of the circuit will be purely 
resistive and minimum, current through the circuit will be 
maximum and will be equal to the applied voltage divided 
by the resistance R. 
 Series resonance 
 From the above discussions it is found that in a series 
RLC circuit, 
 Impedance 7 = \R? 4%, —%n) 
 Current | = oe 
 z 
 and 
 Phase angle 6 = tan Clas 
 If the frequency of the signal fed to such a series LC circuit 
is increased from 0 Hz, as the frequency is increased, the 
inductive reactance(X, = 2nfL) increases linearly and the 
capacitive reactance (X.= 1/2nfL) decreases exponentially. 
Ata particular frequency called the resonance frequency, 
f, the sum of X and X.. becomes zero( X, —   X= 0). 
From above, at resonant frequency , 
—   Netreactance, X= 0   (i.e, X, = X,) 
—   Impedance of the circuit is minimum, purely resistive 
and is equal to R 
 —   Current | through the circuit is maximum and equal to

 —   Circuit current, lis in-phase with the applied voltage V 
fLeé. Phase angle   = 0). 
At this particular frequency   f, called resonance frequency, 
the series RLC is said to in a condition of series resonance. 
Resonance occurs at that frequency when, 
 XK, =X, or anil = 1/2nfC 
 Therefore, Resonance frequency, f, is given by,

 The unit of admittance,   conductance and susceptance 
 is called the mho symbol   O. 
 Relationship between   branch current and supply 
voltage   :   In a R-L parallel   circuit, the voltage across 
resistor (Ep) and inductor (E, ) are the same and equal to 
the supply voltage E. Hence E is the reference vector. The 
current through   resistor (Ip) in phase with Ep is E. (Fig 3) 
The current through inductor (I; )islaggingthe E, isE by 
90°.   In short the current through resistor |p   is in phase 
and the current through   inductor |,, lags with applied 
voltage (E) by 90°. The power factor of R-L parallel cir- 
cuit is cos @ where o is the angle in between the total 
current and applied voltage.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the relationship between branch current, voltage in a parallel circuit 
*   solve problems in RC parallel circuit by admittance method 
*   compare the charecteristics of A.C series and parallel circuits 
*   state the R-L-C parallel circuit vector diagram 
Parallel RC circuits: Ina parallel RC circuit, one or more 
resistive loads and one or more capacitive loads are con- 
nected   in parallel across a voltage source. Therefore, 
resistive   branches,   containing   only   resistance   and 
capacitive branches, containing only capacitance.   (Fig 1} 
The current that leaves the voltage source divides among 
the branches; so there are different currents in different 
branches. The current is, therefore, not   a common quan- 
tity, as itis in the series RC circuits.

 Voltage: In a parallel RC circuit, as in any other parallel 
circuit, the applied voltage is directly across each branch. 
The branch voltages are, therefore, equalto each other. So, 
if you know any one ofthe circuit voltages, you know any 
one of the circuit voltages, you know all of them. 
Branch current: The current in each branch of a parallel 
RC   circuit   is   independent of the   current   in the   other 
branches. The current withina branch depends only onthe 
voltage across the branch, andthe resistance or capacitive 
reactance contained in it. (Fig 2) 
The current in the resistive branch is calculated from the 
equation: Ip = Eqpp/R. 
The current in the capacitive branch is found with the equa- 
The current in the resistive branch is in phase with the 
branch voltage, while the current in the capacitive branch 
leads the branch voltage by 90 degrees. Since the two 
branch voltages are the same, the current in the capaci- 
tive branch (I;) must lead the current in the resistive branch 
(Ip) by 90 degrees. (Fig 3) 
Impedance: The impedance   of a parallel RC circuit rep- 
resents the total opposition to the current flow offered by 
the resistance of the resistive branch and the capacitive 
reactance of the capacitive branch. Like the impedance of 
a parallel RL circuit, it can be calculated with an equation 
that is similar to the one used for finding the total resist- 
ance of two parallel resistances.

 However, just as you learned for parallel RL circuits, two 
vector quantities cannot be added directly, vector addition 
must be used. Therfore, the equation for calculating the 
impedance of a parallel RC circuit is

 (R2 +X," 
 where aR + Xoo   isthe vector addition of the resistance 
and capacitive reactance. 
Incases where you know the applied voltage and the circuit

the resistance or capacitive reactance of the individual 
branches. 
The relative values of X. and R determine how capacitive or 
resistive the circuit line current is. The one that is the 
smallest, andtherefore, allows more branch currenttoflow, 
is the determining factor. 
Thus, if X. is smaller than R, the current in the capacitive 
branch is larger thanthe current inthe resistive branch, and 
the line current tends to be more capacitive. 
The opposite is true if R is smaller than X.. When X.orR 
is 10 or more times greater than the other, the circuit will 
operate for all practical purposes as ifthe branch withthe 
larger of the two did not exist.

*   list a few applications of parallel LC circuits 
*   compare the properties of series and parallel resonance circuits. 
 Parallel   resonance 
 The circuit at Fig 1,   having an inductor and a capacitor 
connected in parallel is called parallel   LC circuit or parallel 
resonance circuit. The resistor R, shown in dotted lines 
indicate the internal DC resistance ofthe coil L. The value 
of R will be so small compared to the inductive reactance, 
that it can be neglected. 
From Fig 1a, itcan be seen that the voltage across Land 
Cis same and is equal to the input voltage V...

 The currentthroughthe inductance |, (neglecting resistance 
R), lags V. by 90°. The current through the capacitor I. 
leads the voltage V. by 90°. Thus, ascan be seen fromthe 
phasor diagram at Fig 1b, the two currents are out of phase 
with each other.   Depending on their magnitudes, they 
cancel each other either completely or partially. 
 fxX.< X%, then |.>1,, and the circuit acts capacitively. 
 If XxX, <X,, then |, > |., and the circuit acts inductively. 
 fx =X.,thenl,   =|., andhence, the circuitacts as a purely 
resistive. 
 Zero current inthe circuit   means thatthe impedance of the 
parallel   LC   is   infinite.   This   condition   at which,   for   a 
particular frequency, f,, the value of X.=X,, the parallel LC 
circuit is said to be in parallel resonance.

 Ina parallel resonance circuit, witha pure L(no resistance} 
anda pure C(loss-less), at resonance the impedance will 
be infinite. In practical circuits, howeversmall, the inductor 
willhave some resistance. Because of this, atresonance, 
the phasor sum of the branch currents will not be zero but 
will have a small value |. 
Thissmall current | willbein phase withthe applied voltage 
andthe impedanceof   the circuit will be very highalthough 
 not infinite. 
 Summarizing, the three main characteristics of parallel 
resonance circuit at resonance are, 
—   phase difference between the circuit current and the 
applied voltage Is zero 
—   maximumimpedance 
=   minimum line current. 
 The variation of impedance of a parallel resonance circuit 
 with frequency is shown in Fig 2. 
In Fig 2, when the input signal frequency to the parallel 
resonance circuit is moved away fromresonant frequency 
f., the impedanceof   the circuit decreases. At resonance 
the impedance é. is given by,

 Atresonance, although the circuitcurrentis minimum, the 
magnitudes of | & |. will be much greater than the line 
current. Hence, a parallel resonance circuit is also called 
current magnification circuit. 
Application of parallel resonant circuits 
Parallel resonance circuits or tank circuits are commonly 
used inalmost all highfrequency circuits. Tank circuits are 
used as collector load in class-C amplifiers instead of a 
resistor load as shown in Fig 3.

 The powerina Oc   circuit can be calculated by using the 
formulae.

The use ofthe above formulaein AC circuits vull give true 
power anly ifthe circuit contains pure resistance. Mote 
that the effect of reactance is presentin AC   circuits. 
Power in &C   circuit: There are three types of power in 
AC   circuits. 
—   Active power (True power] 
—   Readcive power 
—   Apparent po yer 
Active power (True power:   The calculation of active 
powerinan AC   circuit differs tram thatina direct current 
circuit. The active power to be measured is the product of 
Vxlx Cos 6   where Cos 6 isthe power factor (cosine of 
the   phase angle   between   current   and voltage’).   This 
indicatesthat with a load which is not purely resistive and 
where the current and voltage are not inphase, only that 
part of the current which isin phase with the voltage vill 
produce power. This canbe measured with a vvattm eter.

Apparent power: The apparent power, P|   =   ¥ xl. 
The measurement canbe made inthe same way as for 
direct current with a voltmeterand ammeter. 
It iz simplythe product ofthetotal applied voltage and the 
total circuit current and its unit is vott-ampere (YA).

 From   the   equation,   you   can   observe   that   the   three 
powers are related and   can be   represented in a nght- 
angled power triangle, fram which the power factor can 
be obtained as the ratio oftrue power to apparent power. 
Foor inductive loads, the power factor is called lagging ta

load. (Fig 2)

 AC Parallel circuit problem 
Inpractice all industrialand domestic electrical circuits are 
connected in parallel as we follow the constant voltage 
system. Ina parallel circuit, the voltage across any branch 
circuit is the same as the supply voltage. However, the 
arithmetical sum ofthe branch currents does not necessar- 
ily equal the total current. This is true because the branch 
current values may be out-of-phase due to the fact thatthe 
loads connected may be resistive, inductive, (V lead I) or 
capacitive (| lead V). 
Therefore, the total current must be obtained by adding or 
subtracting vectors of the branch currents either math- 
ematically   (admittance   method)   or graphically   (vector 
method). 
Example 1 
Parallel circuit with R and X, in branches 
New consider a parallel circuit having one branch consist- 
ing of a pure resistance andthe other branch having pure 
inductance.

*   distinguish between leading, lagging and zero PF 
*   state the recommended power factor as per ISI 7752 (Part |) 1975 for electrical equipment. 
Power Factor (P.F.) 
The power factor is defined as the ratio of true power to 
apparent power and it is denoted by Cos 0. 
 True Power (W,) 
 i.e, Power Factor =   = Cos 8 
 Apparent Power (W,) 
 ies or   Cos 8 = 
 Where VV_ is the real power (true power) and is measured 
in watts or some times in kilowatts (kKVV).   Similarly the 
product VI is known as the apparent power measured in 
volt amperes or sometimes in kilo-volt amperes written as 
 kVA. 
 The principal cause of a low power factor is due to the 
reactive power flowing in the circuit. The reactive power 
mostly due to inductive load rather than capacitive load. 
Variation in power factor and the type of circuits 
The following are the different conditions of the power factor 
in different circuits. 
Unity power factor 
Acircuit with a unity power factor will have equal real and 
 apparent power, so that the current remains in phase with 
 the voltage, and hence, some useful work can be done. 
(Fig 1a) 
Leading power factor 
A circuit will have a leading power factor if the current 
leads voltage by an angle of @ electrical degrees and the 
true power will be less than the apparent power. Mostly 
capacitive circuits and synchronous motors operated at 
over excitation   contribute for leading   power factor. 
 (Fig 1b) 
 Lagging power factor 
In such a   circuit the true power is less than the apparent 
power and current lags behind the voltage by an angle, in 
electrical degrees. Mostly inductive loads like induction 
motors and inductionfurnaces account for lagging power 
factor. (Fig 1c} 
Zero power factor 
When there is a phase difference of 90° between the current 
and voltage, the circuit will have zero power factor and no 
 108 
 useful work can be done. Pure inductive or pure capacitive 
circuits account for zero power factor. (Fig 1d)

 The power factor can be one or less than one 
but can never be greater than one. 
Table 1   shows the most common electrical appliances 
used, the power in watts and the average power factor. 
Causes of low power factor 
The following are the reasons. 
i   Inindustrialand domestic fields, the induction moters 
are widely used. The induction motors always take lag- 
ging current which results in low power factor. 
ii   The industrial induction furnaces have low power fac- 
tor. 
iii   The transformers at substations have lagging power 
factor because of inductive load and magnetising cur- 
rents. 
iv   Inductive load in houses like fluorescent tubes, mix- 
ers, fans etc. 
The disadvantages of low power factor are as follows. 
a   Fora given true power, a low power factor causes in- 
creased current, thereby, overloading of the cables, gen- 
erators, transmission and distribution lines and trans- 
formers.

The advantages of high power factor are as follows. 
As the higher PF for a given load, reduces the current, 
there will be: 
a   a possibility of connecting extra load on existing gen- 
erators and transmit additional power   through the same 
lines 
b   lesser losses and voltage dropin lines; thereby, trans- 
mission efficiency is high and the voltage at the point 
of application will be normal without much drop 
c   normal voltage improves the efficiency of operation of 
plants and machinery 
d   reduction in electricity bills for the given load during 
the given time. 
 Method of improving the power factor 
 To improve the power factor of a circuit, two methods are 
 used: 
 i   toruna   lightly loaded synchronous motor with over- 
excitation on that line in which the PF is to be im- 
proved 
ii   to connect capacitors in parallel with the load. 
Usually the capacitor method is used in Indian factories. 
Synchronous condenser method 
The synchronous motor is used in certain industries as 
well as inreceiving end substations to drive a mechanical 
load and also to correct the power factor. An over-excited 
synchronous motor draws leading current to compensate 
the lagging current taken by the other loads. 
The leading volt-ampere reactive power taken by a syn- 
chronous moter, when over- excited will be opposite in 
nature to the lagging voltage pure reactive due to inductive 
loads, and, thereby, reduces the volt-ampere reactive com- 
ponent to improve the power factor. 
 Condenser method 
 Capacitors when used for PF improvement are connected 
in parallel to the supply.   In three-phase circuits the ca- 
pacitors are connected in delta across the load lines. Now 
automatic devices are available which can be connected 
 tothe supply lines to detect low power factor and to switch 
 on the required capacity of capacitors in the line to im- 
prove the power factor. 
Normally these capacitors are provided with discharge 
resistances to discharge the stored energy. However,   no 
capacitor terminal should be touched to avoid shock.

Assignment   ii   The true power in watt, apparent power in volt- ampere 
A factory is having a load of 100 kVV working at 0.6 PF 
lagging.   Asynchronous motor is connected in the factory 
and is made to run over-excited to improve the power fac- 
tor. The synchronous motor is of 30 KW and is working at 
0.8 PF leading. Calculate the following: 
i   the true power in watt, aspperent power in VAR for the 
factory load at 0.6p.f lagging. 
and leading reactive power in VAR forthe synchoronous 
moter at 0.8P-F lagging. 
iii   The true power in watt, reactive power in VAR and ap-

3 - PHASE SUPPLY ELI13012 
 One great advantage of a three-phase AC supply is that it 
can produce a rotating magnetic field when a set of sta- 
tionary three-phase coils is energized from the supply. 
This is the basic operating principle for most modern ro- 
tating machines and, in particular, the three-phase induc- 
tion motor. 
Further, lighting loads can be connected between any one 
of the three phases and neutral. 
Review: Further to the above two advantages the follow- 
ing are the advantages of polyphase system over single 
phase system. 
*   3-phase motors develop uniform torque whereas single 
phase motors produce pulsating torque only 
*   Most of the 3-phase motors are self starting whereas 
single phase motors are not 
*   Power   factor of 3-phase motors are reasonably high 
when compared to single phase motors 
*   Fora given size the power out put is high in   3-phase 
motors whereas in single phase motors the power out- 
put is low. 
*   Copper required for 3-phase transmission for a given 
power and distance is low when compared to single 
phase system. 
*   3-phase motor like squirrel cage   induction motor is 
robust in construction and   more are   less   mainte- 
nance free. 
Three-phase generation: To generate three-phase volt- 
ages, a similar method to that used for generating single- 
phase voltages is employed but with the difference that, 
 this time, three wire loops U,,   U., V., V,   and W,, W, 
 rotate at a constant angular speed about the same axis in 
 the uniform magnetic field.   U,, U,, V,, V, and W, , W,, 
 are displaced 120° in position with respect to each other, 
permanently. (Fig 2)

 ELNI65015  SIMPLIFIED THREE — PHASE ALTERNATOR 
 For each wire loop, the same result is obtained as for the 
alternating voltage generator.   This means that an alter- 
nating voltage is induced in each wire loop.   However, since 
the wire loops are displaced by 120° from each other, and 
a complete revolution (860°), takes one period, the three 
induced alternating voltages are delayed in time by a third 
of a period with respect to each other. 
Because of the spatial displacement of the three wire loops 
by 120°, three alternating phase voltages result, which are 
displaced by one third of a period, T, with respect to each 
other. (Fig 3)

 Three-phase network: A three-phase network consists 
of three lines or phases.   InFig5, these are indicated by 
the capital letters U, V and W. 
The return lead of the individual phases consists of a com- 
mon neutral conductor N, which is described later in more 
detail.   Voltmeters are connected between each of the 
lines U,   V and W, and the neutral line N.   They indicate 
the RMS (effective) values of the voltages between each of 
the three phases and neutral. 
These   voltages   are   designated   as   phase 
voltages V,,,, V,, and V,,,, 
The individual, phase voltages all have the same magnitude. 
They are simply displaced from each other by one third of 
a period in time. (Fig 8) 
The individual instantaneous, peak and RMS values are 
the same as for a single-phase alternating voltage.

 Line and   phase voltage:|lf a voltmeter is connected 
directly between line U and line V (Fig 7), the RMS value 
of the voltage V,,, is measured, and this is different from 
any of the three phase voltages. 
Its magnitude is directly proportional to the phase voltage. 
The relationship is shown in Fig 6, where the time-variation 
wave- forms of V_, andthe phase voltages V,,, and V,,.. are 
drawn. 
V_,,fas a sinusoidal wave-form and the same frequency 
as the phase voltages.   However, V, has a higher peak 
value since it is computed   fromthe phase voltages V _,,, 
and V,,,. The varying positive and negative instantaneous 
 values of V,,, and V,,. at a particular time produce the 
instantaneous value of V,.,.   V,,, is the phasor sum of the 
 two phase voltages V/,,, and V.,,. 
This combination of phase-displaced alternating voltages 
is called phasor addition.

possibility of combining pairs of phases ina generator is a 
basic   property   of   three-phase   electricity.   The 
understanding   of this relationship will be enhanced by 
studying the following illustrative example which explains 
the concept of phase difference in a very simple way. 
The phase voltages V,,,and V,,, are separated in phase 
by one third of a period, or   120° between the two phasors.

 The phasor sum of the two phase voltages Vand V,..can 
be obtained geometrically, and the resultant phasor so 
 obtained is the line voltage V_,, through the relation V,,= 
 My   +   Vw 
 Note that to obtain the line voltage V,,,, the measurement 
is made from the U terminal through the common point N 
to the V terminal, for a star connection. 
 Systems of connection   in 3-phase AC 
 This fact is illustrated in Fig 8.   Starting with the phasors 
Vij and V,,, (Fig 7), the phasor — V,,. = V,.,is produced 
fromthe point N.   The diagonal of the parallelogram with 
 sides V,,, and V,,,, is the phasor representing the resulting 
 line voltage V,,,,. 
Itcan be concluded, therefore, that ina generator the line 
voltage V| is related to the phase voltage V,, by a multiplying 
 factor.   This factor can be shown to be   3,   so that 
 Vi =V3 x V, 
 In a three-phase generating system, the line voltage is 
always 4/3 times the phase-to-neutral voltage. The factor 
relating the line voltage to the phase voltage is ,/3. 
It was shown that the line voltage is greater than the phase 
voltage.   Here is   a numerical example. 
The RMS phase voltage in a three-phase system is 240V. 
Since the ratio of line voltage to phase voltage is   ,/3 the 
RMS line voltage is 
 V   =¥3xV,   =/3 x 240 
 =   415.68V 
 or rounded down, V, = 415V.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
 * explain the star and delta systems of connection 
 *   state phase relationship between line and phase voltages and current in a star connection delta connection 
*   state the relationship between phase and the voltage and current in star and delta connection 
Methods of 3-phase connection: If athree-phase loadis 
connected to a three-phase network, there are two basic 
possible configurations.   One is ‘star connection’ (symbol 
Y) and the other is “delta connection’ (symbol A). 
Star connection: In Fig 1 the three-phase load is shown 
as three equal magnitude resistances.   Fromeach phase, 
at any given time, there is a path to the terminal points U, 
V, W of the equipment, and then through the individual 
elements of the load resistance.   All the elements are 
connected to one point N: the ‘star point’.   This star point 
is connected to the   neutral conductor N.   The phase 
 currents i,,, i), andi, flow through the individual elements, 
 and the same current flows through the supply lines, i.e. 
in a star connected system, the supply line current (I)   = 
phase current (1.). 
The potential difference for each phase, i.e. froma   line to 
the star point, is called the phase voltage and designated 
as V..   The potential difference across any two lines is 
called the line voltage V,.   Therefore, the voltage across 
each impedance of a star connection Is the phase voltage 
V.. The line voltage V, appears across the load terminals 
 U-V, V-W and W-U and designated as V,,,,, V,,,, and V,,,, in 
 the   Fig 1.   The line voltage in a star-connected system 
will be equal to the phasor sum   of   the positive value of one 
phase voltage and the negative value of the other phase 
voltage that exist across the two lines (Fig 2).

Derived from these are the corresponding line voltages. 
 The line voltages are displaced 120° in phase with respect 
 to each other.   Since the loads in our example are provided 
by purely resistive impedances, the phase currents I, (I,,, 
 l,,, ly) are in phase with the phase voltages V. (V,.,. Vix 
 and V,,..).   In a star connection, each phase current is 
determined by the ratio of the phase voltage to the load 
 resistance R. 
 Deltaconnection:   There isasecond possible arrangement 
for connecting athree-phase loadina three-phase network. 
This is the delta or mesh connection (A). (Fig 5)

 In   a   three-phase star   connection, the line 
voltageis always V3 times the phase-to-neutral 
voltage.   The   factor relating   the   line voltage

tion can be explained with the aid of an illustration.   The 
line voltages V,,,. V,,, and V,,,,   are directly across the

same as the line voltage.   The phasors V\,,, V,,, and V.., 
are the line voltages. This arrangement has already been 
seen in relation to the delta connection. 
Because of the purely resistive load, the corresponding 
phase currents are in phase with the line voltages. (Fig 6)

 Thus, fora balanced delta connection, the ratio ofthe line 
 current to the phase current is ./3. 
 Thus, line current =   3   xX   phase current. 
 Application of star and delta connection with   bal- 
anced loads 
An important application is the “star-delta change over 
switch’   or star-delta starter. 
Application   of   star   connection:   Alternators   and 
secondoary   of   distributiontransformers, have theirthree, 
single-phase coils interconnected in star. 
Assignment: Three identical coils, each of resistance 10 
ohms and inductance 20mH is delta connected across a 
400-V,   50HZ,   three-phase supply.   Calculate the   line 
current. 
Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
¢   explain the current in neutral of   a 3-phase star connection 
¢   state the earthing the neutral. 
Neutral: In a three-phase star connection, the star point 
 is known as neutral point, and the conductor connected 
 to the   neutral   point   is referred as   neutral   conductor 
 (Fig 1).

 Current in the neutral conductor: In a star-connected, 
four-wire system, the neutral conductor N must carry the 
sum of the currents |,,, |,, and l,,. One may, therefore, get 
the impression that the conductor must have sufficient 
area to carry a particularly high current. However, this is 
not the case, because this conductor is required to carry 
 only the phasor sum   ofthe three currents. 
 |=   Phasor sum   of |,,, |,,and |, 
Fig 2 shows this phasor addition for a situation where the 
loads are balanced and the currents are equal. The result 
is that   the current in the neutral line |, is Zero. 
Therefore, for a balanced load the neutral conductor carries 
no current. 
Earthing of neutral conductor:   Supply of electrical 
energy to commercial   and domestic consumers   is an 
important application of three-pnase electricity. For “low 
voltage distribution’ - in the simplest case, i.e. supply of 
light and power to buildings - there are two requirements. 
1   Itisdesirable to use conductors operating at the highest 
possible voltage but with low current in order to save 
on expensive conductor material.

 ELNI 6502 
 A voltage distribution system according to criterion 2, only 
possible with a low line voltage   below 250 V. However, 
this is contrary to criterion 1. On the other hand, with a 
star connection, a line voltage of 415V is available. In this 
 Power   in   star and delta connections 
 case, there is only 240V between the supply line and the 
neutral conductor. Criterion 1 is satisfied and, to comply 
with 2, the neutral conductor is earthed. 
Indian Electricity Rules: |.E. Rules insist that the neutral 
conductor must be earthed by two separate and distinct 
connections to earth. Rule No.61(1)(a), Rule No.67(1)(a) 
and Rule No.32 insist on the identification of neutral at 
the point of commencement of supply at the consumer''s 
premises, and also prevent the use of cut outs or links in 
the neutral conductor. BIS stipulate the method of earthing 
the neutral. (Code No.17.4 of IS 3043-1966) 
Cross-sectional area of neutral conductor: The neutral 
conductor in a 3-phase,   4-wire system should have a 
smaller cross-section.   (half of the cross-section of the 
supply lines). 
Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain active, appparent and reactive power in AC 3 phase o 
*   explain behaviour of unbalanced and balance load 
*   state the earthing the neutral. 
¢   determine the power in 3-phase star and delta connected balanced load. 
Fig   1   shows the   load   of three   resistances   in   a   star 
connection. So the power must be three times as great 
as the single phase power. 
 P= Vol. 
 If the   quantities Vand   I.in the   individual   phases are 
replaced by the corresponding line quantities V, and |, 
respectively, we obtain: 
 VL el 
 (Because V.=V, , ¥3 andl, =.) 
 P=3 
 Since   3=   3 x J3, this equation can be simplified to 
 the form 
 P= 3 VI, 
 Note that power factor in resistance circuit is 
unity.   Hence power factor is   not taken   into 
account. 
The   power   in   this   purely   resistive   load(d=0°, 
cosd= 1) Is entirely active power which is converted into 
heat. The unit of active power is the watt (WW). 
As the last formula shows, three-phase power in a 
star-connected load circuitcan be calculated fromthe line 
quantities, andthere   is no need to measure the phase 
quantities. 
P=,/3 x Vx |(Formula holds good fer pure resistive load) 
It is always   possible,   in practice,   to measure the   line 
quantities but the accessibility of the star point cannot 
always be guaranteed, and so itis not always possible to 
measure the phase voltages. 
Three-phase   power   with   a   delta-connected   load: 
Fig 2 shows the load of three resistances connected in 
delta. Three times the phase   power will be dissipated.

 butsince3=   3 x   .f3 , this equation can be simplified 
 to the form: 
P=   A VI, (Formula holds good for pure resistive 
load) 
If we compare the two power formulae for the 
star and delta connections, we see that the 
same formula applies to both. In other words, 
the way in which the load is connected has no 
effect on the formulato be used, assuming that 
the load is balanced. 
Active,reactive and apparent power: As you already 
know from AC circuit theory, load circuits which contain 
both resistance and inductance, or both resistance and 
capacitance, take both active and reactive power because 
of the phase difference existing between the voltage and 
current in them.   If these two components of power are 
added geometrically, we obtain the apparent power. Pre- 
cisely the same happens ineach phase ofthe three-phase 
systems. Here we have to consider the phase difference f 
between the voltage and current in each pnase. 
Applying the factor ,’3, the components of power ina three- 
phase system follow fromthe formulae derived for single- 
phase, AC circuits, namely: 
 Apparent power S=VI   S =/3V   |,   VA 
 Active power   P=VICosp   P= /3 Vlcos@   W 
ReactivepowerQ=VIsing   Q=/3V,|sin@   var

AC circuits apply also to three-phase circuits.

Unbalanced load: The most convenient distribution sys- 
tem for electrical energy supply is the 415/240 V four-wire, 
three-phase AC system. 
This offers the possibility of   supplying three-phase, as well 
as single-phase current, to users simultaneously. Supply 
to buildings can be arranged as in the given example.

 Theindividual houses utilize one ofthe phase voltages. L,, 
L,andL, to N are distributed in sequence (light current). 
However, large loads (eg.three-phase AC motors) may be 
fed with the line voltage (heavy current). 
However, certain equipment which needs single or two 
phase supply can be connected to the individual phases 
so thatthe phases will be differently loaded, and this means 
thatthere will be unbalanced loading of the phases of 
the four-wire, three-phase network. 
Balanced load in astar connection: In a star connec- 
tion, each phase current is determined by   the ratio of 
phase voltage and load impedance *Z’. 
This fact will now be confirmed   by a numerical example. 
Astar-connected load consisting of impedances °7'' 
each of   10chms, is connected to a three-phase network 
with line voltage V, = 415V. (Fig 5)

POWER MEASUREMENT - SINGLE WATTMETER  EL114016 
 The two-wattmeter   method   of measuring   power 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to: 
*   measure 3-phase power using two single phase wattmeter 
¢   calculate power factor from meter reading 
*   explain the ‘two-wattmeter’ method of   measuring power in a three-phase, three-wire system. 
Power in a three-phase, three-wire system is normally 
measured by the ‘two-wattmeter method.   It may be used 
with balanced or unbalanced loads, and separate connec- 
tions to the phases are not required.   This method is not, 
however, used in four-wire systems because current may 
flow in the fourth wire, if the load is unbalanced and the 
 assumption that I+ I, + I,,= 9 will not be valid. 
 The two wattmeters are connected to the supply system as 
showninFig1. Thecurrentcoils of the two wattmeters are 
connected in two of the lines, and the voltage coils are 
connected from the same two lines to the third line.   The 
total power is then obtained by adding the two readings:

 Consider   the total instantaneous power in the system 
 P= P,+P.+ P,where P,, P,and P,are the instantaneous 
 values of the power in each of the three phases.

 Now i,V\,,/8 the instantaneous power in the first wattme- 
 ter, and i,,V,,,, is the instantaneous power in the second 
 wattmeter. Therefore, the total mean power is the sum of 
the mean powers read by the two wattmeters. 
It is possible that with the wattmeters connected correctly, 
one of them will attempt to read a negative value because 
of the large phase angle between the voltage and current 
for that instrument.   The current coil or voltage coil must 
then be reversed and the reading given a negative sign 
when combined with the other wattmeter readings to 
obtain the total power. 
At unity power factor, the readings of two wattmeter will 
be equal.   Total power = 2 x one wattmeter reading. 
Vhen the power factor = 0.5, one of the wattmeter''s read- 
ing is zero and the other reads total power. 
When the power factor is less than 0.5, one of the watt- 
meters will give negative indication.   In order to read the 
wattmeter, reverse the pressure cail or current coil con- 
nection.   The wattmeter will then give a positive reading 
but this must be taken as negative for calculating the total 
 power.

Phase sequence 
A three-phase   alternator   contains three   sets   of   coils 
positioned   120° apart and its output is a three-phase 
voltage as showninFig 1. Athree-pnase voltage consists 
of three voltage waves, 120 electrical degrees apart. 
At a time 0, phase U   is passing through zero volts with 
positively increasing voltage. (Fig1) V follows withits zero 
crossing 1/3 of the period later andthe same applies to   W 
with respect to V. The order in which the three-phases 
attain their maximum or minimum values is called the 
phase sequence. Inthe illustration given here the phase 
sequence is UV,W.

 EL113711  3 - PHASE OUTPUT VOLTAGE 
 Importance of correct phase sequence: Correct phase 
sequence is important inthe construction and connection 
of various three-phase systems.   For example,   correct 
phase sequence is important when the outputs of three- 
phase alternators   must   be   paralleled   into   a   common 
voltage system. The phase “U'' of one alternator must be 
connected to phase “U'' ofanotheralternator. The phase’ V'' 
to phase V'' and phase ‘VV to phase ‘VV’ must be similarly 
connected to eacn other. 
Inthe case of aninduction motor, reversaloftnhe sequence 
results in the reversal of the direction of motor rotation 
which will drive the machinery the wrong way. 
Phase-sequence indicator(meter): A pnase-sequence 
indicator (meter) provides a means of ensuring the correct 
phase-sequence of a three-phase system. The phase- 
sequence   indicator consists of 3 terminals   “UVW"''   to 
 which three-phases of   the supply are connected. VVhen the 
 supply is fed to the indicator a disc in the indicator moves 
either in the clockwise direction or in the anticlockwise 
direction. The direction ofthe disc movementismarkedwith 
anarrowhead onthe indicator. Below the arrowhead the 
correct sequence is marked. (Fig 2)

 Chemical eafects of eectnic curren 
 ‘There are some liquids in which 4 passage of electric 
currentis accompanied by chemical changes.’   This effect 
if known as chemical effect of electric current. 
The applications of chemical effect ofelectic current may 
be observedin daily lite; é.g., nickel or copper plating an 
metallic artides, production ofE MF bya cell, etc. lity 
leads taken from the positive and negative terminals ata 
battery are immersed ina salted water thenthe production 
of bubbles can be seen at the lead ends   tis all due ta 
chemical effect ofelecric current. 
 Electrotysts 
 The process of chemical changes due to the passage otf 
an electric currentthrough a liquid or a solution is called 
electrolysis. 
 Electrobyte 
 "The liquid or solution which undergoes 4 chemical change 
in ft on acoount of the paszage af an electric current, is 
called an electrolyte’: 6.9., salted water, acidic or a basic 
eolution etc. 
Electrodes (Anode and cathode) 
‘Two conductor plates are immersed inthe liquidto farm a 
passage   of   current   through   it,   they are   known   as 
Blectrodes''. The dectrade through which the current enters 
the liquid, is called a positive electrode or anode, while 
the other through which ft leavesthe liquid felectrolyted is 
called a negative electrode or cathode. 
lons 
During electrolysis, the molecules of the electrolyte split 
into their constituents whcih are called ions. Vvhen apd. 
is aoplied across the two electrodes, the positively charged 
ions Coat ions) move towardsthe cathode and the negatively 
charged   ions fan ions) move towards the anode. On 
reaching at any electrode , anion give up its charge and 
ceases ta be anion. The process of converting atoms 
into iansis called lonization 
Electrochemical equivalent: The mass of a substance 
liberated ordeposited during electralysisby one coulomb 
ofelecticty is termed a¢ electrochemical equivalent (ECE) 
ofthat substance .

 The ECE ofsilver is   7.1162 milligram scoulomb. 
Coulomb: The coulomb (lo isthe unit of electric charge 
(3) orthe quantity of electricity. 
The coulomb is the product of current in ampere and time 
in seconds,

Electroplating 
The process of depositinga metal onthe surface of another 
metal   by   electrolysis   is   known   as   electroplating. 
Electroplating   is   widely   used   in   giving   an   attractive 
appearance and finish to all types of products.   In this 
process inferior metals are coated with costly metals (such 
assilver, nickel, gold, chromium, etc.) to give anattractive 
shiny appearance   and rust-proof surface. 
Conditions for electroplating 
Thefollowing conditions must be fulfilled before electroplating 
an article. 
i   Thearticle to be electroplated must have a chemically 
cleaned surface, i.e. it must not have any sort of dirt, 
rust and greasy surface. 
ii   The article to be plated should form a cathode. 
iii   The anode must be of the metal to be deposited for 
maintainingthe   concentrationofthe solution constantly 
during electrolysis. 
v   The metal to be coated has to be inthe solution of an 
electrolyte. 
The electrolyte is contained ina wooden reinforced cement 
concrete tankwhichis known asa   vat". The anode as well 
asthe article to be plated are hungthrough the conducting 
wires so as to dip inthe solution. The value of the current 
is adjusted according tothe metal deposited onthe surface 
area ofthe article. The time required for electroplating can 
be calculated if we know the mass of the metal deposited 
and ECE with the formula 
 M = Zit

 Current required for plating 
Low pressure direct current (DC) supply is always used for 
electroplating purposes. The pressure used varies from 1

Cathodic protection (CP) isatechnique usecto control the 
corrossion of a metal surface by making itas the cathode 
of an electrochemical cell.   Asimple method of protection 
connects the   metal   to   be   protected to   a   more   easily 
corroded sacrifical metal to act as the anode. 
The sacrificial metal then corrodes instead of the protected 
metal. For the structures such as long pipe lines where 
passive galvanic cathodic protection is not adequate an 
external DC electrical power source is used to provide 
sufficicent current. 
The CPsystem protects a wide range of metallic structures 
steel water, fuel pipe line, storage tanks water heaters, 
steel   wire pipes, oil platform, oil well casing, wind farms 
etc. Another common applicationis in galvanised steel in 
which a sacrificial coating of zinc on steel parts protects 
 themfromrust. CP protectioncan insome cases prevents 
 the stress corrossion cracking. 
Type of cells 
Cell: Acell is an electrochemical device consisting of two 
electrodes made   of   different materials and an electrolyte. 
The chemical reaction between the electrodes and the 
electrolyte produces a voltage. 
Cells are classified as 
*   dry cells 
*   wet cells. 
A dry cell is one that has a paste or gel electrolyte. With 
newer designs and manufacturing techniques, itis possible 
to completely (hermetically) seal a cell. With complete 
seals and chemical control of gas builc-up, itis possible to 
use liquid electrolytes indry cells.   Today theterm ‘dry cell'' 
refers to acellthat can be operatedinany position without 
electrolyte leakage. 
Wet cells are cells that must be operated in an upright 
position. These cellshave ventsto allow the gases generated 
during charge ordischarge to escape. The most common 
wet cell is the lead-acid cell. 
Cells are further classified as primary and secondary cells. 
Primary cells: Primary cells are those cells that are not 
rechargeable. That is, the chemical reaction that occurs 
during discharge is not reversed. Thechemicals used inthe 
reactions are all convertedwhen the cellisfully discharged. 
It must then be replaced by a new cell. 
Types of primary cells: 
 ¢   Voltaic cell 
 ¢   Carbon-zinc cell (Leclanche cell and Dry cell) 
 *   Alkaline cell 
 *   Mercury cell 
 *   Silver oxide cell 
 *   Lithiumcell 
 Dry cell (Carbon-Zine cell): The danger of spilling the liquid 
electrolyte fromaLeclanche typeof celllecdto the invention 
of another class of cells called dry cells. 
The most common and least expensive type of a dry cell 
is the carbon-zinc type (Fig 1). This cell consists of a zinc 
container which acts as the negative electrode.   In the 
centre isa carbon rod which is the positive electrode. The 
electrolyte takes the form of a moist paste made up of a 
solution containing ammonium chloride.

 As with all primary cells, one of the electrodes becomes 
decomposed as part of the chemical reaction. In this cell 
the negative zinc container electrode is the one that is used 
up. As a result, cells left in equipment for long periods of 
time   can   rupture,   spilling   the   electrolyte   and   causing 
damage to the neighbouring parts. 
Carbon-zinc cells are produced in a range of common 
standard sizes. These include   1.5 VAA Cand Dcells (AA 
Pen type cell, “C'' medium size and   ''D'' largefeconomy 
size). 
Uses: Primary cells are usedinelectronic products   ranging 
from watches,   smoke alarms, cardiac   pacemakers, 
torches, hearing aids, transistor radios etc. 
Internal resistance: The output voltage froma cell varies 
asthe load onthe cellchanges. Load onacell refers tothe 
 amount of current drawn from the cell. As the load in- 
 creases, the voltage output drops. The change in output 
voltage is caused by the internal resistance of the cell. 
Since materialsfrom which the cellis made are not perfect 
conductors, they have resistance. Current flowingthrough 
the external circuit also flows through the internal resist- 
ance of the cell. 
Defects of a simple cell: With a simple voltaic cell, the 
strength of current gradually diminishes after some time. 
This defect is mainly due to two causes. 
 *   Local action 
 *   Polarisation 
Local action: Inasimple voltaic cell, bubbles of hydrogen 
are seento evolve from the zinc plate even on opencircuit. 
This   effect   is termed   local   action.   This   is due   to the 
presence of impurities like carbon, iron, lead, etc. in the 
commercial zinc. This forms small local cells on the zinc 
plate and reduces the strength of current of the cell.

plate with mercury. To doso, the zinc plate is immersedin 
dilute sulphuric acid for a short time,   and   afterwards, 
mercury is rubbed over its surface. 
Polarisation: As current flows, bubbles of H, evolve atthe 
copper plate on which they gradually forma thin layer. Due 
tothisthe current strength   falls and finally stops altogether. 
This effect is called the polarization ofthe cell. 
Polarisation can be prevented by using some chemicals 
which will oxidize the hydrogen to water before it can 
accumulate onthe plate. The chemicals used to remove 
polarisation are called de-polarisers. 
Secondary cell: A cell that can be recharged by sending 
electric current inthe reverse direction tothat of a discharge 
mode is known as a secondary cell. 
The secondary cell is also called a storage cell since after 
 it is charged it stores the energy until it is used up or 
 discharged. 
Types of secondary cells 
—   Lead acid cell 
—   Alkaline cell or nickel-iron cell

 Container: The container is made of hard rubber, glass or 
celluloid to accommodate the active plates, separators 
andthe electrolyte. The plates restonribs providedatthe 
bottom of the container and the space between ribs is 
known as sediment chamber. 
Plates: Positive plates are of two types. 
—   Plante plate or formed plates 
—   Faure plate 
Plante plates: These are prepared by the process of 
repeated charging and discharging. They are madeof pure 
lead atthe beginning which changes to lead peroxide after 
charge. 
Faure   plate:   Pasted   or   Faure   plates   are   made   of 
rectangular lead grid into which the active material i.e. 
lead peroxide (Pb ©.) is filled in the form of a paste 
 (Fig 3).

 Separators: These are made ofthin sheets of chemically 
treated porous woodorrubber. They are usedto avoid short

Post terminal:   A small pole extended upward from each 
group of welded plates from the plate connecter ( Fig 6) 
forms the post terminal. 
Electrolyte: The electrolyte used in a lead acid cell   is 
dilute sulphuric acid (H,SO,). The specific gravity of the 
electrolyte   is   1.24 to   1.28.   It varies   according to the 
manufacturer''s specification. 
Working principle 
The secondary cell   has no significant electrochemical

reaction taking place in it, the lead sulphate eletctrode 
change to soft or sponge lead, (Pb- negative plate) andthe 
other electrode changes to lead peroxided(Pb O,,- positive 
plate). 
At the same time the electrolyte solution is strengthened 
and becomes strong sulphuric acid (H.,S0,) (Fig 7).

Capacity:   The   unit   of   capacity   of   a   storage   cell   is 
ampere-hour (AH). It is the product of the rated current of 
acell/battery inamperes and the time in hours at which it 
can discharge that rated current, 
Capacity = Current x Time - AH 
Temperature and specific gravity: The temperature of 
the electrolyte must be kept at 27°C andthe specific gravity 
 at 1.250 + 0.010. 
 Excess temperature willcause more sulphationand buckling 
of the positive plate.

 ¢   Partial short 
Hard sulphation: Overdischarging or the cell being leftin 
a discharged condition fora longtime cause sulphationon 
both electrodes and offers high internal resistance.   The 
sulphation (hard) can be removed by recharging the cell for 
a longer period at a low rate called a trickle charge. 
Buckling: The bending of electrodes due to overcharging 
and discharging, improper electrolyte and temperature is 
known as buckling. 
Partial   short:   The   sediments falling   from   the   plates 
(electrodes) shart- circuiting the positive and   negative 
electrodes cause overheating of the particular cell during 
both charging and discharging periods. Suchacell may be 
replaced with a new one.

 BEGATEE SEE   FILLER CAP   Chemical changes: Oncischarge, potassium hydroxide 
 POSE ROLE   (KOH) splits up into K and (OH)ions.   ie.   into potassium 
and hydroxide ions. OH ions travel towards the negative 
 NEGATIVE crip ——_L,   and oxidise the iron.   Kions go te the anode and reduce Ni 
 (OH), to Ni (OH},. During charging, the opposite reactions

 Itis seenfromthe equation that the electrolyte acts merely 
 r_ Neel entire   as a source for transfer of OH ions from one plate to 
 ICKEL IN LAYER   )   another. It does not take part in any chemical change. As 
a resultthe density does notchange tothe same extent as 
|_ souID STEEL   in an ordinary lead acid cell.   Thus, the density of the 
 CONTAINER   electrolyte remains almost the same during the action. 
 Charactereristics: The emf ofthe cell whenfully charged

 EEE 1   aie   é   falls below 1.15, the cell is fullly discharged.

The positive plate   is made of Nickel hydroxide(Ni(OH),) 
tubes and perforated steel ribbon wound spirally and held 
together by steel ribs, and the whole lot is nickel-plated. 
The negative plate is mace of a nickel steel strip with fine 
perforation. The electrolyte is 21% solution of potassium 
hydroxide   (KOH) along with some quantity of lithium 
hydrate(LiQH). 
*   Itis superior to a lead acid cell in mechanical strength, 
durability and robustness. 
Moreover, as compared to lead-acid cells, the 
alkaline   cells   operate   much   better   at   low 
temperatures, do not emit cbnoxious fumes,

 Grouping of cella:   Often an electric circuit requires a 
voltage or current that   4   single   cell   is not   capable   of 
supplying alone. In this case it is necessary to connect 
groupe of cellsin various series and parallel arrangements. 
Series connections   Cells are connecded in series by 
connectingt he postive terminal afane celltothe negative 
terminal ofthe next cell (Fig 13. 
 Fy i 
 Identical cells are connected in series to obtain a higher 
voltage than   is available   from   a   single   cell. With this 
connection of cells, the output voltage is equal to the sum 
ofthe voltages ofall the cells. However the ampere hour 
(4H rating remains equal to that ata single cell.

 Parallal connection Cells are connected in parallel by 
connecting all the positive terminals together and all the 
negative terminalstog ether (Fig 3). 
Identical cells are connected in parallel to obtain a higher 
output current or ampere-hour rating vith this connection

 Heceseityot changing During discharge duetochemical 
reaction, the active electrodes become 3m aller and the 
inte mal resistance becomes high causing alovvoutput. Ta

orcell inthe apposite directianta thatotthe discharge. This 
process is called charging. The charging can be done 
through a battery charger. 
Battery   chargers\Vhen   the   chemical   reaction   in   a 
rechargeable batters has ended the batteryis said ta be 
discharged and can no longer produce the rated tow ot 
electric current. This battery can be recharged, however, 
by passing direct current from an outside source to flay 
through itin a direction opposite te that in which it   flowed 
out ofthe battery. 
When charging a battery, the negative lead ofthe charger 
must conmect to the negative lead of the battery and the 
posit velead othe chargertothe positive lead ofthe battery 
Asim ple variable-voltage DC po wersupply works well as

Charging   cument:   When   charging   any   battery,   it   is 
important   to   set   the   charging   current   ta   a   value 
recommended bythe manufacturer. This current iz set by 
adjustnent ofthe output voltage onthe charger andreadby 
an ammeter connected   in series with the charger and 
battery (Fig 1). ¢vhen the battery and charger are at the 
same voltage no current flows. The charger voltageis set 
toa value higher thanthat ofthe batter, to produce acurrent 
flows

Voltage tests of lead-acid batteries,   like primary cells, 
should be conducted under load. To make a simple light 
load voltage test of a car battery, check the value of the 
battery output voltage with and without the headlights on. 
Amaximum load voltage test can be made by meteringthe 
battery   voltage   while   operating   the   starting   moter 
(Fig 3). Inthe case ofa 12 battery, adropof battery output 
voltage below 7V indicates the battery is defective or not 
fully charged.

 High rate discharge tester: The internal condition of the 
cellis determined by thistest.   Alow range (0-3V) voltmeter 
is shunted by a low resistance (Fig 4). The two terminal 
procs are pressed onto the terminals of a cell fortesting. 
Afully charged cell which isin good condition reads inthe

 The meter is having three colours red, yellow and green - 
redfortully discharged, yellow for half charge, green forfully 
charged condition of the cell respectively. 
The methods of charging the secondary cells are: 
*   constant current method 
*   constant potential method 
*   rectifier method. 
Constant current method: This methodis used where the 
supply is high voltage DC 220 V, 110 V, etc. butthe battery 
is of low voltage 6 V, 12 V, etc. The emf ofthe battery is 
small in comparison to the supply voltage so a lamp-load 
ora variable resistor is connected in series with the battery 
(Fig 5). This   causes a loss of energy, so, the method is 
inefficient. 
 Fig 5 
 / 
 ELN216718  CONSTANT CURRENT METHOD 
 Use: Forcharging more number of cells at constant current 
rating. 
Constant potential method: Inthis method, the voltage 
is maintained at a fixed value about 2.3 V per cell; the 
current decreases as the charging proceeds. A variable 
resistor is connected in series, so a voltage source of 2.5 
to 2.6 V per cell is required. Fora 12 V motor car battery, 
the charging dynamo is of about 15 V. Incomparisonte the 
constant current method less power is wasted for charging 
and less time is taken. Fig   6 shows the connections for a 
constant potential method of charging batteries.

 Rectifier   method:   A rectifier for   battery   charging   is 
 generally made of diodes connected inthe formofa bridge 
(Fig 7).   Atransformer is usecito step down the AC voltage 
to that suitable for diodes. Ammeter, voltmeter, switches 
and fuses are also used in the rectifier set.

 Trickle charge: VWhenthe battery is chargecat avery low 
rate, that is 2 to 3% of the normal rate for a long period, it 
is said to be a trickle charge.

 Guidlines for installation of battenes 
The following guide linésto be followed during installation 
ofbatteres at residential building 
*   Location otbattery installed should be tree trom heat 
sources and flame. 
"   Battery connection   cables   should   be   as   short   as 
possibleto preventexcesai ve voltage drop. 
=   Before connecingthe battery the positive and negative 
poles must be caretully checked to ensure correct 
installation. 
»   Authorized and trained person mustonlybe allowed for 
installation. 
*   f the batteries to be installed in the accessories like 
remote controls frat openthe battery cover ingert the 
batteries correctly into +veand -veendsthenclosethe 
battery cover and press it ta clase. 
*"   Do not   expose the batteries ta heat (or) lame. 
="   Wanutacturer’:   instruction must   be followed shen 
installing the batteries. 
=   Folloye the local, tate   and Mational electricity code. 
»   Wheninstalling abattery bank alwaysbe caretul since 
shack hazard may be present. 
Care and maintenance of batteries:   The   lead acid 
hatteries must be operated under the right conditions it 
they are to function properly. Regular maintenance   is 
necessaryin orderta maintain proper conditions and thus 
prolong the lite ofthe battery. 
The battery shouldnothe discharged beyondthe minitt urn 
Value of voltage say, 1.75 V tor 2 battery. 
The batteryshouldnotbekeptunder a discharged condition 
for a long time. 
The level of the electrolyte should always be kepttoa 
minimum   of 10 to 15   mm   above the plates by adding 
distilled veater only. 
The battery should never be charged and discharged at a 
higher rate which weak ensthe plate structure lt shouldbe 
done asper the manufacturer''s instructions. 
The battery should be recharged asearly as possible atter 
discharge. 
4 discharged battery should never be tested sith a high 
rate discharge tester. 
The high rate discharge tester should be used only on 
charged batteries and tor lesz thanten seconds.

 The specitic gravity ofthe electrolyte should be checked 
regularly before and atter a battery is put an   charge. 
Thebattery chargingroom shoudalwaysbe well ventilated 
forthe gases to escape reel. 
The battery tenminals must be free from corrosion. The 
tenninals must alweys be kept dean and petroleum jelly 
should be applied onthem. 
The   spilling   of the electrolyte   over the battery causes 
corrosion and it should   be cdeanéed with   soda water or 
am tionia water. 
lfthe battery hasnot been used for along periodthen the 
battery shouldbe put on a tickle change. 
The vent plugs should be kept open while charging, tor tree 
liberation of gases. 
Avoid overcharging and discharging ata high rate. This 
causesthe platesto bend fram their position and buckle. 
Precautions :   Wake sure the   cell temperature during 
charge does notexce ed the   limit specified (43°C las per 
themanutacturer''sinatruction. 
4 fully charged battery stored at 100°F (38°C) vill loose 
almost allits chargein S30 days. The same battery stored 
at BOF ASC ll loose a littl ofits charge in the same 
period ofS0 days. Hightem perature decreases the charging 
rate and shortens the   life. 
Therate ofcharging atthe end afihe period called tinishrate 
is   most   important.   It   must   mot   exceed   the   value 
recommended bythe manufacturer. 
Duringrecha ging, thelead acid battery produces tammable 
gases.   An   accidental   spark   can   ignite   these   gases, 
causinganexplosioninaidethebattery. Such anexplosion 
can breakthe battery case and throvvacid onthe peaple 
and equipmentinthe area. 
Do mot top up the cell vith improper water such as tap 
Water, wellwwater, mineral water or acids which vill cause 
hard eulphation and increase the internal resistance. 
Avoid improper cdeaning agents for terminal   posts and 
metal parts of the battery like emery or sandpaper. Use 
only the recommended deaning agents such as baking 
soda water(lvvarm J, am monia water, and wipe with cotton 
cloth or with anold brush. 
Always wear satety glasses when working with lead acid 
celle and batteries. If acid   does come   in contact with

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the necessity of tapping natural resources for energy 
*   state about the solar cell /photo voltaic cell 
*   explain the basic principle, construction and characteristics of the solar cell. 
Heat energy 
Heatenergy is the most sought energy for human being to 
cook the food as well as to keep warm in cold climate. 
However the use of   woodasthe fuel forfire, has ended up 
indeforestation and resulted in drought. 
Searchoftfuel ledthe manto use coalandthenoil. However 
these commodities are fast dwindling and afterfew hundred 
years both may completely vanish from earth.   As suchit 
isessential that human race should find alternative source 
of energy fromnature. 
Hence the use of natural resources like heat from sun 
thought by several scientists and one of the solutions to the 
energy crisis is the invention of solar cells. 
 Solar cell / Photovoltaic cell 
 A solar cell,   or photovoltaic cell,   is an electrical device 
that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by 
the photovoltaic effect, which is a physical and chemical 
phenomenon. It is a form of photoelectric cell, definedasa 
device whose electrical characteristics, such as current, 
voltage, or resistance, vary when exposed to light. Solar 
cells are the   building   blocks of photovoltaic   modules, 
otherwise known as solar panels. 
Solar cells are described as being photovoltaic irrespective 
of whether the source is sunlight or an artificial light. They 
are   used   as a   photo-detector   (for example   infrared 
detectors),   detecting   light or other electromagnetic 
radiation near the visible range, or measuring light intensity. 
The operation of a photovoltaic (PV) cell requires 3 basic 
attributes: 
*   The absorption of light, generating electron-hole pairs 
extraction. 
*   The separation of charge carriers of opposite types. 
*   The separate extraction of those carriers to an external 
circuit. 
The solar cells is essentially a large photo diode designed 
to operate as photo voltaic device and to give as much 
output power as possible. Whenthese cells aré under the 
influence of lightraysfromsun, they give outabout   100 mw/ 
 cm? power. 
 Fig 1   shows the construction, symbol andcross section of 
a typical power solar cell. The top surface consist of a 
extremely thinlayer of P-type material through which light 
can penetrate to the junction.

 The nickel plated ring around the P-type material is the 
positive output terminal,   and the bottom plating   is the 
negative output terminal. Commercially produced solar 
cells will be available inflatstripformfor efficient coverage 
of available surface areas. 
According to different manufacturing standards, the output 
power varies from 50mw/cm? to   125mw/cr’ . The graph 
shows the characteristic of a solar cell which gives   100mw/ 
cm°*.   Considering the characteristic curve it is apparent 
thatthe cell will deliver an output current of   50mA whenthe 
output terminals are short circuited then the output voltage 
will be zero. 
On the other hand open circuited voltage of the cell will be 
0.55mv butthe outputcurrentis zero. Therefore againthe 
output power is zero.   For maximum output power the 
device must be operated atthe knee of the characteristic. 
In   solar   cells   the   output   power   decreases   at   high 
temperature. 
Several cells must be connected in series to produce the

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
¢   classify, specify, identify and state the uses of the accessories employed in domestic wiring 
¢   state the IE rules related to safety and electric supply. 
Electrical accessories:   An electrical domestic acces- 
sory is a basic part used in wiring either for protection and 
adjustment or fer the control of the electrical circuits or for 
a combination of these functions. 
Rating of accessories: The standard current ratings of 
the accessories are 6, 16and32 amps. The voltage rating 
 is 240V AC as per B.I.S. 1293-1988. 
 Mounting ofaccessories: The accessories are designed 
to mount either on the surface or concealed (flush type). 
Surface mounting type: Accessories are provided with 
aseating so thatwhen mounted they project wholly above 
the surface on which they are mounted. 
Flush-mounting type: These accessoriesare designed 
to mount behind or incorporated with a switch plate, the

 Holding accessories 
Lamp-holders :   A lamp-holder is used to hald a lamp. 
Earlier,   brass holders were   most commonly used but 
nowadays these have beenreplaced by bakelite holders. 
These may contain solid or hollow spring contact termi- 
nals. Fourtypes of lamp-holders are mainly available. 
—   Bayonetcaplamp-holders 
—   Screw type holders 
—   Edison screw type lamp-holders 
—   Goliath Edison screw type lamp-holders 
Bayonetcap(BC)lamp-holders: |nthis type the bulbis 
fitted into the slot, and is held in position by means of two 
pins inthe lamp cap. It has solid or hollow spring contact 
terminals, and the supply mains through the switch are 
connected to these contacts. In BC types there are two 
grooves onthe circular construction of all types of holders. 
Pendent lamp-holders:   This holder (Fig 6) is used in 
places where   the lamps are required inahanging position. 
These holders are mace of either brass or bakelite. An 
exploded view of this holder shows the   parts of the holder. 
These   holders are   used   along with   ceiling   roses for 
suspending the lamps from the ceiling.

 SAFETY RULES: Among safety rules, the following are 
important and indeed requires attention. Every rule in the 
Indian Electricity Rules 1956 is related either directly or 
indirectly to safety. 
Rule 32: Switches shall be on the live conductor. No cutout, 
link or switch other than gang switch shall be inserted in 
the neutral conductor. Code of Practice of wiring shall be 
followed while marking the conductors. 
Rule   50:   Energy   shall   not   be   supplied, 
transformed,converted   or used   unless the   following 
provisions are observed. Asuitable linked switch or circuit 
breaker is erected at the secondary side of the transformer. 
Every circuit is protected by a suitable cut-out. Supply to 
each motor or group of motors is controlled by a linked 
switch or circuit breaker. Adequate precautions are taken 
to ensure that no live parts are exposed. 
Special provisions in respect of high and extra high 
voltage installations 
Rule 63:   Approval   of   Inspector is   necessary before 
energising any high voltage installations. 
Rule 65:   The   installation   must   be subjected to the 
prescribed testing before energizing. 
Rule 66:   Conductors   shall   be enclosed   in a metallic 
covering and suitable circuit breakers shall be provided to 
protect the equipment from overloading. 
Rule 68: Incase of outcoor type of sub-station a metallic 
fencing of not less than 1.8 m height shall be erected around 
the transformer.

 Circuit Breaker (CB) - Miniature Circuit Breaker (MCB)- Moulded Case Circuit 
Breaker   (MCCB) 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the types, working principle and parts of a miniature circuit breaker. 
*   state the advantages and disadvantages of MCB 
*   state the categories and applications of MCBs 
*   state the application, advantage and disadvantage of MCCBs. 
 Circuit Breaker 
 Acircuit breaker is a mechanical switching device capable 
of making, carrying and breaking the currents under normal 
condition   and   breaking   the   currents   under   abnormal 
conditions like a short circuit. 
Miniature circuit breaker (MCB) 
Aminiature circuit breakeris a compact mechanical device 
for making and breaking a circuit both in normal condition 
and in abnormal conditions such as those of over current 
and short circuit. 
Types of MCB’s 
MCBs are manufactured with three different principles of 
operation namely 
 a   Thermal Magnetic 
 b   Magnetic hydraulicand 
 c   Assisted bimetallic 
 Out of three MCB''s thermal magnetic MCB is discussed 
 below 
 Thermal magnetic MCB 
Theswitching mechanismis housed ina moulded housing 
with phenolic moulded high mechanically strongswitching 
dolly. This type of MCB is also provided with bimetallic 
overload release (Fig 1). 
The electric current gets through two contacttips one each 
on moving and fixed contact of silver graphite. 
Anarcing chamber incorporating de-ionising arc chutes for 
control and quick suppression ofthe arc is provided inthe 
gap betweentwocontacts.   Ithasaribbed opening closed 
by metal grid which allows ventilation and escape of gases.

THERMAL MAGNETIC TYPE MGB  ELN227031 
 For protection against over-load and short circuit, MCB’s 
have thermal magnetic release unit. The overloadistaken 
care of by bimetallic strip,   short circuit currents and over 
loads of more than 100% are taken care by solenoid. 
Working 
The bimetallic strip when flexing due to temperature rise 
caused by increasing normal rated current beyond 130% 
rotates a   trip lever carrying an armature to which it is to 
brought into field of a solenoid. The solenoid is designed 
to   attract the   armature to full   position   at about 700% 
overload or instantaneous shart circuit current. 
For initial portion of current wise (130% to 400%) tripping 
of circuit breaker is due to thermal action, between 400 to 
700% tripping is due to combined thermal and magnetic 
action and beyond 700% due to fully magnetic action.

Certain manufacturers like Indo Kopp manufacture the 
MCBs in three different categories namely ‘L’ series, ‘G’ 
series, and ‘DC’ series. 
 ‘L’ series MCBs 
 ‘L’   series   MCBs are   designed to   protect circuits with 
resistiveloads. They are ideal for protection of equipment 
like Geysers, ovens and general lighting systems. 
 ‘G'' series MCBs 
 ‘G’   series MCBs are designed to protect circuits with 
inductive loads.   Gseries MCBs are suitable for protection 
of motors, air conditioners, handtcols, halogenlampsetc., 
 ‘DC’ series MCBs 
 ‘DC’ series MCBs are suitable for voltage upto 220V DC 
 and have a breaking capacity up to 6kA. 
 The tripping characteristics are similar to ‘L’ an‘G’ series. 
They find extensive application in DC controls, lacomo- 
tives, diesel generator sets etc., 
Advantages of MCB 
1   Tripping characteristic   setting   can   be done   during 
manufacture and it cannot be altered. 
2   They will trip for   a sustained overload   but   not for 
transient overload. 
Faulty circuit is easily identified. 
Supply can be quickly restored. 
Tamper proof.

Disadvantages 
1   Expensive. 
2   More mechanically moving parts. 
3   They require   regular testing to ensure satisfactory 
operation. 
4   Their characteristics are affected by the ambient tem- 
perature. 
Moulded Case Circuit Breakers (MCCB) 
Moulded   case   circuit   breakers   are   similar to   thermo 
magnetic type MCBs except that these are available in 
higher ratings of   100 to 800amp at S00V 3-phase. 
InMCCB, thermal and magnetic releases are adjustable. 
Ashuntrelease is also incorporated for remote tripping and 
interlocking at MCCB.   MCCBs are provided with under 
voltages release. There are two types of MCCB. 
1   Thermal   magnetic type. 
2   Fully magnetic type (Fig 2). 
Advantages of MCCB 
1   MCCBs   occupy much less space in comparison to 
fuse switch units. 
2   MCCBsprovide equalamountof protectionagainsthigh 
faults as switch gears having HRC fuses. 
Disadvantages 
1   MCCBs are much costlier. 
2   Leakproofsituationrequired. 
3   Sensitivity to insulation resistance low.

 ELCB - types - working principle - specification 
 Objectives - At the end of this exercise you shall be able to 
*   explain the working principle, different types and construction of an earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB) 
¢   explain the technical specifications of ELCB’s. 
 Introduction 
 The sensation of electric shock is caused by the flow of 
electric current throughthe human body to earth. Whena 
person comes in contact with electrically live objects like 
water heaters, washing machines electric iron etc., the 
extent of damages caused by this current depends on its 
magnitude and duration. 
This kind of current is called the leakage current which 
comes in milli-amps.   These leakage current being very 
smallinmagnitude, hence undetected by the fuses/MCBs 
are the major cause for the fires due to electricity. 
The leakage current to earth also results inthe wastage of 
energy and excessive billing for electricity not actually 
used. 
These residual current circuitbreakers (RCCB) are popularly 
called as Earth leakage circuit breakers (ELCB). 
Basically ELCBs are of two types namely voltage operated 
ELCBs and the current operated ELCBs. 
Voltage operated ELCB 
This device is used for making and breaking a circuit.   It
