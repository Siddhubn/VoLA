Definition of joint:   4 joint in an   electrical conductor 
means connecting ying or interlaying together of two or 
more conductors such thatthe   unionjuncion becomes 
se cured both electrically and mechanically. 
Typesot joints: In electrical work diferent   types otf joints 
are Used, based on the requirement. The service ta be

 Tap joints in single stranded conductors of diameter 
2mmorless: By definition, a tap isthe connection of the 
end of ane wire to   some point along the runof   another wire. 
The following types of taps are commonly used. 
—   Plain 
Aerial 
Knotted 
Cross -   Double - Duplex 
Plain tap joint: (Fig 8) This joint is the most frequently 
used, andis quickly made. Soldering   makesthe joint more 
reliable.

 ELN1a2518  PLAIN TAP JOINT 
 Aerial tap joint   : (Fig 9) This joint   is intended for wires 
subjected to considerable movement, and itis left without 
soldering for this purpose. This joint is suitable for low 
current circuits only.   It is   similar to the plain tap joint 
except that   it   has   a   long   or easy twist to   permit the 
movement of the tap wire over the main wire.

 Knotted tap joint : (Fig 10) A knotted tap jointis designed 
to take considerable tensile stress. 
Soldering - types of solders, flux and   methods of 
soldering 
Soldering:   Soldering is the process of   joining two metal 
plates or conductors without melting them, with an alloy 
called solder whose melting point is lower than that of the 
 Fig 10 
 ELN13251A  KNOTTED TAP JOINT 
 metals to be soldered. The molten solder is added to the 
two surfaces to be joined so that they are linked by a thin 
film of the solder which has penetrated into the surfaces. 
Necessity of soldering: Wire andcable   jointsshould have 
the same electrical conductivity and mechanical strength 
asthat ofthe parent conductor. This cannot be achieved by 
amere mechanical joint. As such cable joints are soldered 
 to have good mechanical strength, electrical conductivity 
 and also to avoid corrosion. 
Solders : The following are the general proportions of tin 
and lead used in the solders.

Lead-40% | 365°F.   electrical 
joints etc. 
Solder used for copper: The   metal alloy   used as a 
bonding agent in solderingis calledasolder. The solders 
used for soft soldering consist of an alloy (mixture) of 
mostly tin and lead. 
Factors influencing the choice of a solder 
The factors that influence the choice of a solder are: 
*   melting point 
*   solidification range 
*   strength 
*   hardness 
*   sealability 
*   price. 
Flux:   Flux is a substance used to dissolve oxides on the 
surface of conductors and to protect against de-oxidisation 
during the soldering process. 
General properties of flux : Tne purpose of the flux is to 
*   dissolve oxides,   sulphides etc.   thereby making the 
soldering surface free of oxides and dirt 
*   prevent re-oxidation during the soldering operation 
thereby making the solder adhere to the surface to be 
soldered. 
*   facilitate the flow of the solder through surface tension

 Soldering methods 
Soldering with a soldering   iron: The   most common 
method of soldering is with a soldering iron as shown in 
Fig 1. This is widely used for most kinds of soft soldering 
work, 
 SOLDERING IRON 
 This tool is simple and inexpensive. Soldering irons are 
available ina wide range of sizes and models. 
 ELN132521 
 Temperature controlled soldering 
For soldering miniature components on   printed circuit 
boards, atemperature-controlled soldering ironis used as 
showninFig 2. The electrical supply given to the soldering 
iron is of low voltage, and is completely isolated fromthe 
main supply. Low voltage does not endanger the   life ofthe 
user   and   will   also   not   spoil   the   sensitive   electronic 
components. Controlled temperature makes the jobeasy 
for the user.

 ELN1S2822  TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED SOLDERING IRON 
 Soldering witha soldering gun: This method, shown in 
Fig 3, is used for individual soldering, e.g. forservicingand 
repair work. 
The principle of this method is that an electric current   flows 
through a wire coil heatingit. Tne temperature is difficultto 
check,   and overheating can easily occur.   This is the 
disadvantage.

 ELN1 32623  SOLDERING WITH A SOLDERING GUN 
 Soldering with a flame: Soldering with a flame is Used 
when the heat capacity of a soldering iron Is insufficient. 
This method, shown in Fig 4, permits rapid heating and is 
used primarily for larger jobs, such as piping and cable 
work, vehicle body repairs and some applications in the 
buildingtrade. 
 Fig 4 
 SOLDERING WITH BLOWLAMP  ELN132824 
 This method requires skilful management of the flame. 
Dip soldering: This method, shown in Fig 5, is used for 
quantity productionandfortinning work similarto component 
solderingon Printed Circuit Boards (P.C.B.). Components 
to be soldered or tinned are dipped into a bath of molten 
solder, which is heated electrically. 
The temperature can be controlled very accurately.

 Techniques of soldering : Soldering involvesthe following 
main operations. 
«   Tinningthe soldering iron 
*   Cleaning the parts to be soldered 
*   Applyingthe solder 
Tinning the soldering iron: To make the solder adhere 
to the tip of the soldering iron, the surface ofthe tip must 
be coated with the solder, and this operation is known as 
tinning. 
First the tip is cleaned with a cloth and heated either 
directly or indirectly. The tip is then filed to remove the 
scales, and is wiped again with a cloth. 
The right temperature for tinning could be judged by the 
change of colour ofthe tip when heated. Ifthe surface of the 
copper tip tarnishes immediately, the temperature is high 
and needs to be cooled slightly by withdrawing the source 
ofheattemporarily. Acorrectly heated tiptarnishes slowly. 
Afterthe soldering irontip attains the correct temperature, 
place a small quantity of solder and the flux on atin plate 
and rub the bit on the mixture. The solder should stick to 
the surface of the tip evenly. Wipe out the superfluous 
 solder with a clean damp cloth. 
 The whole process of   tinningis shownin Figures 6a and

 ELN1a2535  TINAING PROCESS 
 The surface should present a bright silvery appearance 
when properly tinned. 
Cleaning the surface to be soldered:   The parts to be 
soldered should be wellcleanedfor perfect soldering. The 
scales, dirt, oiland grease should be completely removed 
either by wiping or by rubbing witha sandpaper. Immediately 
after cleaning, the flux should be applied onthe surfaceto 
avoid oxidization. 
Applying the flux: The rosin which is recommended as 
a flux may be sprinkled over the surface to be soldered or 
may be applied with a brush as shown in the Fig 7. 
 Fig7 
 ELN132537  APPLYING SOLDERING FLUX 
 Applying the solder:   The quantity of the solder to be 
applied depends uponthe size of the job.   For small jobs like 
printed circuit boards soldering or soldering joints in wires 
of diameter 2 mmorlower, an electric soldering iron is used 
whereas for soldering joints of large sized cables, pot and 
ladle are used. 
Soldering precautions: Remove the ironas soonas the 
solder has flowed over the surfaces. 
Excessive heating may damage: 
*   the wire and its insulation 
*   the component being soldered 
*   the adjoining components. 
Soldering with pot and ladle (Fig 3): For larger sized 
jobs like underground cable   jointing, a melting pot and ladle 
are used.   The solder is kept inthe pot and heated either 
by a blowlamp or by charcoal. Initially the surface to be 
soldered is cleaned and a coat of flux is given. 
 Fig 8 
 ELN1a2538  POT AND LADLE METHOD OF SOLDERING 
 Then the surface to be soldered   is heated by pouring 
molten solder over it in quick succession. The dripping 
solder is collected ina cleantray. After several pourings, 
the surface attains the same temperature as that of the 
molten solder. The flux is again applied and the solder is 
slowly poured on the surface as it forms an even layer.

conductors is more difficultthansoldering copper conductors 
owing tothe highly tenacious, refractory and stable nature 
ofthe oxide filmwhichforms immediately on any aluminium 
exposed to alr. 
This oxide film does notallow the solder to wetthe surface 
tobe soldered, andalso prevents the solderfrom entering 
the   interior surface   by capillary action.   Hence   special 
solders and fluxes are used for aluminium soldering. 
Solder:   A special soft solder having a small percentage 
of zinc is used for joining aluminium conductors.   (Soft 
solders are alloys which have a melting point below 300°C. ) 
IS 5479-1985 gives details of the chemical composition of 
soft solders and their grades used forsoldering aluminium 
conductors. Details are givenin Table 1. 
The object of this small zinc content which is   a common 
feature of aluminium solders is to fecilitate the alloying of 
 the solder with an aluminium surface. Atypical composition 
 of solder with   51%   lead,   31%   tin,   9   % zinc   and   9% 
cadmiumwiththe brand name “ALCAF'' solderis available 
in the   market for   soldering   aluminium   conductors.   In 
addition   a   special   solder   by   name   Ker-al-lite   is   also 
available for soldering aluminium conductors. 
Flux: Insoldering aluminium conductors, organicfluxes of 
reaction type, free from chlorides   and suitable for soft 
soldering are used. 
The composition of the organic fluxes decomposes at 
approximately 250°C to effectthe removal of the oxide film 
and also to assist in the spreading of the molten solder to 
enable tinning the de-oxidised surface immediately. 
The major disadvantage of organic flux is that it tends to 
charatatemp. above 360°C. The charring, thus caused, 
renders the flux ineffective and gives rise to the danger of 
creating voids inthe joint due to charred flux residues. For 
this reason,   it is essential that the temp.   of this solder 
during the operation is maintained well within 360°C. The 
commercial name of fluxes used for joining aluminium 
conductors are Kynal Flux and Eyre No.7. 
 Procedure   of soldering   aluminium cables   :   The 
 procedure   of soldering   aluminium   cables to   standard 
copper lugs employing Kynal''s flux and Ker-al-lite special 
solder is explained below. 
Strip the cable   in preparation for jointing in the usual 
 manner. 
 Spread outthe strands so as to effect a general loosening 
andslight displacementof   the wires, andcleanthe surface 
preferably with a wire brush. 
Apply a small quantity of flux by brushing well inte the 
fanned-out ends of the conductor and baste (moisten) the 
fluxed conductor with a full ladle of molten solder. 
Apply more flux and baste again with the molten solder. 
Continue to make repeated alternate applications of flux 
and solder until the wires exhibit a brightly tinned surface 
free from dull spots. 
After the final basting, wipe off the surplus metal from the 
strands with a clean and dry piece of cloth. 
Flux the lug inner surface and fill it with the molten solder. 
Insert the tinned end of the cable inside the lug and hold 
both the cable and the lug firmly without shaking. 
Allow the lug to cool and baste the surface quickly with the 
molten solder to remove the excess solder. 
Wipe the lug surface with a clean cloth. 
Apply a coating of graphite conducting grease on the lug 
before using. 
Precautions to be followed while soldering aluminium 
All surfaces must be scrupulously clean. 
Whena jointis being made between stranded conductors, 
the strands must be stepped! to increase the surface area. 
The surface   must   be   fluxed   before the heat is applied. 
Safety 
During the jointing operation copious fumes are given off 
when   the flux   is   heated.   These   fumes   contain   small 
quantities of fluorine, and itis, therefore, advisable not to 
inhale them. 
As smoking during the jointing operation results in the 
inhaling oftoxicfumes, smoking duringsoldering should be 
avoided.

Under ground (UG) cables - construction - materials - types - joints - testing 
 Objectives: At the end ofthis lesson you shall be able to 
*   define UG cable 
*   explain the construction of UG cables 
list   and state the insulating materials used in cables 
list out and state the types of UG cables used for 3 phase service 
state the types of cable joints and laying methods 
expalin the faults and testing procedures of cables. 
Under Ground (UG) cables 
“A cable so prepared that it can withstand pressure and 
canbe installed below the ground level and normally two 
or more conductors are placed inan UG cablewith sepa- 
rate insulation on each conductor” 
Electric power canbe transmitted (or) distributed either by 
over-head lines system or by underground cable system. 
The underground cable system have several advantage, 
such 
Advantages 
*   Less chance to damage through storms or lightning. 
«   Low maintenance cost. 
«   Less chances of fault. 
Disadvantages 
However, their major draw back / disadvantages are 
*   Initial cost of UG cable system is heavy. 
¢   The cost of joints are more. 
¢   Introduce   insulation   problems   at   high   voltages 
compared with ©.H lines. 
For these reasons UG cables are employed where it is 
impracticable to use ©.H lines like (i) thickly populated 
areas, where municipal authorities prohibit O.H lines for 
the reason of safety. 
ii   Around plants 
iii   In Substations, 
Vv   Vvhere maintenance conditions do not permitthe use 
of O.H construction. 
 General construction of UG cables 
 Anunderground cable essentially consists of one or more 
conductors covered with suitable insulation and surrounded 
by a protecting cover. 
Necessity requirements for cables 
In general, a cable must fulfill the following necessary 
requirements. 
i   Theconductor used incables should be tinnedstranded 
copper or aluminum of high conductivity. (Strands of 
cable gives flexibility and carry more current). 
 48 
 ii   The size ofthe conducter should be selected, so thatthe 
cable carries the desired load currentwithoutoverheating 
and limits the voltage drop to a permissible value. 
iii   The cable must have proper   thickness   of insulation to 
ensure the safety and reliability for the designed voltage. 
v   The cable must be provided with suitable mechanical 
protection so that it may withstand the rough use in 
laying it. 
v   The materials used in cables should be with complete 
chemical and physical stability throughout.

 ELN122814  CONSTRUCTION OF CORE CABLE 
 i   Cores or conductors: Acable may have one or more 
than one core (conductor) depending upon the type of 
service for which it is intended.   For instance, the 3- 
conductor cable shown in Fig 1   is used for 3-phase 
service.   The conductors are made of tinned copper or 
aluminium and are usually stranded in order to provide 
flexibility to the cable and having high conductivity. 
ii   Insulation: Each core or conductor is provided witha 
suitable thickness of insulation, the thickness of layer 
depending upon the voltage to be withstood by the cable. 
The   commonly   used   materials for   insulation   are 
impregnated paper, varnished cambric or rubber mineral 
compound. Petrolium jelly is applied   to the layers of 
the cambric to prevent damage. 
iii   Metallic sheath:   In order to protect the cable from

The metallic sheath is usually a lead 
or lead alloy. 
iv Paper Belt: Layer of imprignated paper tape is wound 
round the grouped insulated cores. The gap inthe cores 
is filled with fibrous insulating material (jute etc. ) 
v Bedding: Cver the metallic sheath is applied a layer of 
bedding which consists of a fibrous material like jute 
orhessiantape.   The purpose of bedding is to protect 
the   metallic   sheath   against corrosion   and   from 
mechanical injury due to armouring. 
vi   Armouring: Over   the bedding, armouring is provided 
which consists of one ortwo layers of galvanized steel 
wire or steel tape.   Its purpose is to protect the cable 
from mechanical injury while laying it and during the 
course of handling.   Armouring may not be done inthe 
case of some cables. 
 vii Serving: In order to protect armouring from atmospheric 
 conditions, a layer of fibrous material (like jute) similar 
to bedding is provided overthe armouring. This is known 
as serving. 
It may not be out of place to mention here that bedding, 
armouring and serving are only applied to the cables for 
the protection of conductor insulation and to protect the 
metallic sheath from mechanical injury. 
The principal insulating materials used in cables are 
i   Rubber 
ii   Vulcanized India rubber 
ili   Impregnated paper 
Vv   Varnished cambric and 
v   Polyvinyl chloride. 
Classification of cables 
Cables for underground service may be classified in two 
ways according to (1) the type of insulating material used 
 in their manufacture (ii) the voltage for which they are 
 manufactured.   However, the later method of classification 
is generally preferred as 
i   Low-tension (L.T} cables — upto 1100 V 
ii   High-tension (H.T) cables — upto 11,000 V 
ili   Super-tension (S.T cables —from 22 KV to 33 KV 
Vv   Extra high-tension (E.H.T) cables — from 33 to 66 KV 
v   Extra super voltage cables — beyond   132 KV 
A cable may have one or more than one core depending 
uponthe type of service for which it is intended.   It may be 
(i) single-core (ii) two-core (ili) three-core (iv) four-core etc. 
For a 3-phase service, either 3-single core cables or three- 
core cable can be used depending upon the operating 
voltage and load demand. 
Single core   low tension   cable:   Fig   2   shows the 
constructional details of a single-core low tension cable. 
The cable has ordinary construction because the stresses 
developed in the cable for low voltages (upto 6600 V) are 
generally small.   It consists of one circular core of tinned 
stranded copper (or aluminium) insulated by layers of 
impregnated paper.

 Cables for 3-Phase Service 
 In practice, underground cables are generally required to 
 deliver 3-phase power.   For the purpose, either three-core 
cables or three single core cables may be used.   For 
voltages   upto   66   KV,   3-core   cable   (i.e.   multi-core 
construction) is preferred due to economic reasons. The 
following types of cables are generally used for 3-phase 
service. 
1   Belted cables — upto 11   KV 
2   Screened cables — from 22 KV to 66 KV 
3   Pressure cables — beyond 66 KV 
 1   Belted cables : These cables are used for voltages 
upto   11   KV   but   in extraordinary cases their use 
extended upto 22KV. (Fig 3)

 These cables are meant for use upto 33 KV butin particular 
cases their use may be extended to operating voltages 
upto 66 KV.   Two principal types of screened cables are 
H-type cable and S.L. type cables. 
i   H-type cables: This type of cable was first designed 
by H. Horchstadter and hence the name. Fig 4 shows 
the constructional details of a typical 3-core,   H-type 
cable.   Eachcore ''s insulated by layers of impregnated 
paper.   The insulation on each core is covered with a

(ii) S.L. type cables   Fig 5   shows the constructional 
details of 3-core S.L (separate lead) type cable.   It is 
basically H-type cable but the screen round each core 
insulation is covered by its own lead sheath.   There is no 
overall lead sheath but only armouring and serving are 
provided. 
The S.L type cables have two main advantages over H- 
type cables. 
a   Theseparate sheaths minimize the possibility of core- 
to-core breakdown. 
b   Bending of cables become easy due to the elimination 
of overall lead sheath. 
The disacivantage Is that the three lead sheaths of S_L. 
cable are much thinner than the single sheath of H-cable

 For voltages beyond 66 KV, solid type cables are unreliable 
because there is a danger of breakdown of insulation due 
to the presence of voids. When the operating voltages are 
greater than 66 KV, pressure cables are used. Two types 
of pressure cables viz oil filled cables and gas pressure 
cables are commonly used. 
i   Oilfilled cables.   Insuch type of cables, channels of 
ducts are provided inthe cable for oil circulation.   The 
oil   under   pressure   (it   is   the   same   oil   used for 
impregnation) is kept constantly supplied to the channel 
by   means of external   reservoirs placed at suitable 
distances (say 500 m) along the route of the cable. 
Oil   under pressure compresses the   layers   of paper 
insulation and is forced into any voids that may have formed 
between the layers.   Due to the elimination of voids, oil- 
filled cables can be used for higher voltages, the range 
being from 66 KV upto 230 KV. 
Oil-filled cables are of three types viz. 
i   Single-core conductor channel 
ii   Single-core sheath channel and 
ili   Three-core filler-space channels. 
i   Single-core Conductor channel

a   Formation of voids and ionization are avoided. 
b   Allowable temperature range and dielectric strength are 
increased. 
c   If there is leakage, the defect in the lead sheath is at 
once indicated and the   possibility of earth faults is 
decreased. 
Disadvantages 
a   High initial cost and complicated system of laying 
ii   Gas pressure cables. The voltage required to set up 
ionization inside a void increases as the pressure is 
increased. Therefore, if ordinary cable is subjected to 
a   sufficiently high   pressure,   the ionization   can   be 
altogether eliminated. At the same time, the increased 
pressure produces radial compression which tends to 
 close any voids. This is the underlying principle of gas 
 pressure cables. 
Fig 9 shows the section of external pressure cable designed 
by Hockstadter, Vogal and Bowden.   The construction of 
the cable is similar to that an ordinary solid type except 
that itis of triangular shape and thickness of lead sheath 
is 75% that of solid cable. The triangular section reduces 
the weight and gives low thermal resistance but the main 
reason for triangular shape is that the lead sheath acts as 
a pressure membrane.   The sheath is protected by a thin 
metal tape.   The cable is laid is a gas-tight steel pipe. 
 Figg 
 EXTERNAL PRESSURE CABLE  ELN132819 
 The pipe ts filled with dry nitrogen gas at a pressure of 12 
 to 15 atmospheres.   The gas pressure produces racial 
compression and closes the voids that may have formed 
between the layers of paper insulation. 
Advantages: 
a   Cables can carry more load current 
b   Operate at higher voltages than a normal cable. 
c   Maintenance cost is small and the nitrogen gas helps 
in quenching any flame. 
Disadvantages: 
The overall cost is very high. 
Further the cables are also classified according to their 
insulation system as under: 
PVC insulated cables   (Poly vinyl chloride) 
Ml cables 
 PILC cables 
 (Mineral insulation) 
(Paper insulated lead covered) 
 XLPE cables 
 PILCDTA cables (Paper insulated lead covered 
double tape armoured) 
(Cross linked poly ethylene) 
UG cables laying method 
The reliability of the underground cable (UG) installation 
depends upon the proper laying and attachment of fittings 
(i.e) cable and boxes, joints, branch connectors etc. 
Methods of laying of UG cables 
The following are the methods of laying underground cables 
Laying direct in ground 
Laying in ducts 
Laying on racks in air. 
Laying on racks inside a cable tunnel.

 Laying along buildings or structures. 
Precautions while handling cables 
1   Preventthe cable from dragging on the floor. 
2   Prevent kinking of the cable. 
3   After   laying   the   cable   in   the   ducts   it   should   be 
immediately covered or suspended. 
Cable jointing methods: This process consists of the 
following steps. 
a   Exact measurementofthe cable for insulationremoval. 
 b   Removal of insulation. 
 c   Replacing of the original   insulation with high grade 
tapes and sleeves. 
d   Dressingthe cable ends and conductor joints through 
sleeves/split sleeves. 
e   Providingseparators between cables. 
f   Fixing acast iron or any other protective shell around 
the joint and filling the joint boxes with molten bitumen 
compound. 
g   Plumbing metallic sleeves or brass glands to the lead 
sheath of the cable to prevent moisture from entering 
the   joint   in   case   of   cast   iron   joint   boxes   or tape 
insulation in case of cast resin kit joint boxes. 
Straight through joints 
The emphasis should be laid on quality and selection of 
proper cable, cable accessories, proper jointing techniques. 
For   PILC   cable:   For   paper   insulated   lead   sheathed 
cables, straight joints are made either by using sleeve 
joints or crimping joints upto voltage grade   11 KV. Above 
11KV, compoundfilled copper or brass sleeves, alongwith 
cast iron, fibre glass protection boxes are used. 
Fig 10 shows such   a joint. 
Tee joint: These joints are to be restricted up to 11 KV. 
These   joints are made either using cast resin kits or €.1.

 Method of preparing and filling compounds 
—   Hotpouring 
—   Coldpouring 
Hot pouring compounds: A bituminous compound of 
meltingtemperature 90°C and pouring temperature 180°C 
- 190°C is used for hot pouring. 
Cold pouring compound: Cold pouring is used by using 
cast resin system for PVC cable jointing. This has been 
developed for application up to   11 KV grace cables. The 
compound consists of a   resin   base   and a   polyamino 
hardener. Thetwo component liquids are mixed atthe site 
inaccordance withthe recommendation ofthe manufacturer. 
Types of cable faults and testing procedure 
The common faults which are likely to occur in cables 
 are: 
 1   Ground   fault.   The   insulation   of the   cable   may 
breakdown causing a flow of current fromthe core of 
the cable to the lead sheath or to the earth.   This is 
called “Ground Fault”, 
2   Short circuit fault.   If the   insulation   between two 
conductors is faulty,   a current flows between them. 
This is called a “short circuit fault”. 
Methods for locating ground and short circuit faults. 
The methods used localizing the ground and short circuit 
faults differ fromm those used for localizing open circuit faults. 
Inthe case of multi core cables it is advisable, first of all, 
to measure the insulation resistance of each cere to earth 
and also between cores.   This enables us to sort out the 
core that is earthed in-case of ground fault; and to sort out 
the cores that are shorted in case of a short circuit fault. 
Loop tests are used for location of ground short circuit 
 faults.   These tests can only be used if a sound cable 
 runs along with the faulty cable or cables. 
The loop tests work cn the principle of a Vvheatstone bridge. 
The advantage of these tests is that their setup is such 
that the resistance of fault is connected in the battery 
circuit and therefore does not effect the result.   However, if 
the fault resistance is high, the sensitivity is adversely 
affected.   Inthis section only two types of tests viz., Murray 
and Varley loop tests are being described. 
Murray Loop Test. The connection for this test are snown 
in Fig 13a relates to the ground fault and Fig 13b relates 
to the short circuit fault. 
In   both   cases,   the   loop circuit formed   by the cable 
conductors is essentially a whneatstone bridge consisting 
of resistances P Q, R and X. G is a galvanometer for 
indication of balance, 
The resistors P. Q forming the ratio arms may be decade 
resistance boxes or slide wires. 
 Under balance conditions : 
 x Q,   x   a 
 R   P   R+X   P+ 
 2x-—   (R+X) 
 P+Q 
 Where (R+9) is total loop resistance formed by the sound 
cable and the faulty cable.   When the conductors have 
the same cross-sectional area and the same resistivity, 
the resistance are proportional to lengths.   If|, represents

 The above relation shows that the position of the fault may 
be located when the length of the cable is known.   Also, 
the fault resistance does not alter the balance condition 
because its resistance enter the   battery circuit hence 
effects only the sensitivity of the bridge circuit.   However, 
if the magnitude of the fault resistance is high, difficulty 
may be experienced in obtaining the balance condition on 
account of decrease in sensitivity and hence accurate 
determination   of the position of the fault may not   be 
possible. 
Insuch a case, the resistance of the fault may be reduced 
by   applying   a   high   direct or   alternating   voltage,   in 
consistence with the insulation rating of the cable, onthe 
liné so as to carbonize the insulation at the point of the 
 fault. 
 Varley   loop test.   In   this   test we   can   determine 
experimentally the   total   loop   resistance   instead   of 
calculating it fromthe known lengths of the cable and its 
resistance per unit length.   The necessary connections 
for the ground fault are shown in Fig 14a and for the short 
circuit fault in Fig 14b.   The treatment of the problem, In 
both cases, is identical. 
Asingle pole double throw switch Ais used in this circuit. 
Switch K   is first thrown to position ‘I’ and the resistance 
''S'' is varied and balance obtained. 
Measurement of resistance 
Let the value of S for balance be S. The four arms of the 
Wheatstone bridge are PP Q R+X,&, at balance: 
 R+X P 
 $   Q

 This determines R + X i.e. the total loop resistance as P 
 Qand S, are known.

Equations for murrary loop test and   varley loop test are 
valid only when the cable sections are uniform throughout 
the loop. Corrections must be applied in case the cross- 
sections of faulty and sound cables are different or when 
the cross-section ofthe faulty cable is not uniform over its 
entire length. 
Since temperature   affects   the value   of   resistance, 
corrections   must   be   applied   on this   account   if the 
temperatures of the two cables are different.   Corrections

Kirchhoff''s law and   its applications 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
 ¢   state Kirchhoff sfirst law 
 *   apply Kirchhoff''s first law to find the circuit current 
* state Kirchhoff’s second law and apply the same to find the voltage drop in branches 
* solve problems by applying Kirchhoff''s laws. 
Kirchoff''s   laws   are   used   in determinig the equivalent 
resistance of   acomplex networkandthe current flowingin 
the various conductors. 
Kirchhoff''s laws 
Kirchhoff''s first law: At each junction of currents, thesum 
ofthe incoming currents is equal to the sumof the outgoing 
currents. (Fig   1) (or) Thealgebric sum ofall branch currents 
meeting at a point/node is zero

 Ifallinflowing currents have positive signs and all outflowing 
currents have negative signs, then we can   state that

 Kirchhoff''s second law:   Inclosed circuits, the applied 
terminal voltage V is equal to the sum ofthe voltage drops 
V,+¥V, and so forth. (Fig 3) 
If allthe generated voltages are taken as positive, and all 
the consumed voltages are taken as negative, thenit can 
 be stated that: 
 in each closed circuit the sum of all voltages is equal te 
 Zero.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the characteristics of series circuit and determine the current and voltage across each resistors 
¢   determine the total voltage sources in series circuit 
*   state the relation between EMF potential difference and terminal voltage. 
 The series circuit 
 lf more than one resistors are connected one by one likea 
chainandifthe current has only one pathis called as series 
circuit. Itis possible to connect two incandescent lamps in 
the way showninFig 1. This connectionis calleda series 
connection, in which the same current flows in the two 
 lamps.

 The lamps are replaced by resistors in Fig 2.   Fig 2 (a) 
shows two resistors are connected in series between point 
Aand point B. Fig2(b) shows four resistors are in series. 
Of course, there can be any number of resistors inaseries 
connection. Suchconnection provides only one pathfor the 
current to flow.

 The current will be the same at any point of the series 
circuit. This can be verified by measuring the current in any 
two points ofa givencircuitas shown in Figs 3a and 3b. The 
ammeters will show the same reading. 
The current relationship in a series circuit is

 We can conclude thatthere is only one path forthe current 
to flowin a series circuit. Hence, the current is the same 
throughout the circuit.

 The total resistance in a series circuit is equal to the sum 
of the individual resistances aroundthe series circuit. This 
statement can be written as 
where R   is the total resistance 
Faia PR, Pegg R, are the resistors connected in series. 
When a circuit has more than one resistor of the same

In DC circuit voltage divides up across the load resistors, 
depending upon the value of the resistor so that the sum of 
the individual load voltages equals the source voltage. 
As the source voltage divides/drops across the series 
resistance depending upon the value of the resistances 
the total voltage of a series circuit must be measured 
across the voltage source, as shown in Fig 4.

 Electromotive force (emf) 
 We have seenthat the electromotive force (emf) ofacellis 
the open circuit voltage, and the potential difference (PD) 
is the voltage across the cell whenitdeliversa current. The 
potential difference is always less thanthe emf. 
Potential difference 
PD =emf—voltage drop in the cell 
Potential difference can also be called by anotherterm, the 
terminal voltage, as explained below. 
Terminal voltage 
It is the voltage available at the terminal of the source of 
supply.   Its symbol is V..   Its unit is also the volt.   Itis given 
by the emf minus the voltage drop inthe source of supply, 
 i.e.   Vv, =emf—IR 
 where lis the current and R the resistance of the source. 
Voltage drop (IR drop) 
The voltage lost by resistance in a circuit is called the 
 Voltage dropor IR drop. 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain a parallel circuit 
*   determine the voltages in a parallel circuit 
*   determine the current in a parallel circuit 
*   determine the total resistances in a parallel circuit 
*   state the application of a parallel circuit. 
In an electrical circuit, if the current has more than one 
paths and equal voltage in each branch is called parallel 
circuit. 
It is possible to connect three   incandescent lamps as 
showninFig 1. This connectioniscalléed parallel connection 
inwhich, the same source voltage is applied across allthe 
three lamps. 
Voltage in parallel circuit 
Thelamps inFig1 are replaced by resistors inFig 2. Again 
the voltage applied across the resistors is the same and 
also equal to the supply voltage. 
Ve can conclude thatthe voltage across the parallel circuit 
is the same as the supply voltage.

 Mathematically it could be expressed as V = V, = V.,= V.,

Again   referring to Fig 2   and applying Ohm''s law,   the 
individual branch currents in the parallel circuit could be 
determined.

Refer to Fig 2 in which the branch currents I,, |,and |, are 
shown to flow into resistance branches R,,   R, and R, 
respectively. 
The total current | in the parallel circuit is the sum of the 
individual branch currents. 
 Mathematically it could be expressed as | = |, + 1, +1, + 
 Resistance in parallel circuit 
In a parallel circuit,   individual branch resistances offer 
oppositiontothe current flow though the voltage across the 
branches will be same. 
Let the total resistance in the parallel circuit be R ohms. 
By the application of Ohm''s law 
 we can write 
 Vv   V 
R=—   ohmsor |   =— amps. 
| 
 where 
 R is the total resistance of the parallel circuit in onms 
Vis the applied source voltage in volts, and 
| is the total current in the parallel circuit in amperes. 
We have also seen

 As V isthe same throughout the equation and dividing the 
above equation by V, we can write 
 1   1   1   ae 
RR,   Ry   R, 
 The above equation reveals that in a parallel circuit, the 
reciprocal of   the total resistance is equal ta the sum ofthe 
reciprocals of the individual branch resistances. 
Applications of parallel circuits 
The electric system   used   in   homes consists of many 
parallel circuits. 
An automobile electric system uses parallel circuits for 
lights,   horn,   motor,   radio   etc.   Each   of these   devices 
operates independent of the others. 
Individual television circuits are quite complex. However, 
the complex circuits are connected in parallel to the main 
power source. Thatis why the audio section of television

*   state the effect of shorts and open in parallel circuit. 
Shortcircuits   Detecting shortcircuit 
A short circuit is a path of zero or very low resistance   When   the   ammeter   in the   circuit   indicates   excessive 
compared to the normal circuit resistance.   current then it indicates a short circuit in the circuit.   The 
location of shortin a circuit can be detected by connecting 
a voltmeter across each of the elements (resistors) and 
circuit source.   If the voltmeter indicates zero volts or 
Inaseries circuit, shortcircuits may be partial orfull (dead 
short) as shown in Fig 1 and Fig 2 respectively.

 Use a voltmeter on a range that can accommodate the

turn.   Ifone of the wires is open as shown in Fig 4, the full 
 supply voltage Is indicated on the voltmeter. Inthe absence 
 of a current, there is no voltage drop across any of the

 Alternatively,   the open   circuit may be found using an

show no continuity (infinite resistance), when connected

 Shorts and opens in parallel circuits 
The two possible defects that can occur in an electrical 
circuit they are: 
«   short circuit 
*   opencircuit 
Shorts in parallel circuit: 
Fig / shows a parallel circuit with short between points ‘a’ 
and ‘b’. 
This causes reduction ofcircuit resistance almost to zero. 
Therefore, the voltage crop across ‘ab’ will be almost zero 
(by Ohms law).

 Thus   current through   the   resistors   R,,   R,,   R, will   be 
negligible and not their normal current. 
The result isthat a very high current inthe order of hundred 
times of the normal current will flow through the short 
circuit. 
A short circuit exists when current can flow from the 
positive terminal of the power source through connecting 
wires and back to the negative terminal of the power source 
without going through any load. (Fig 3}

 Short circuit may cause burning of the circuit 
elements like cables, switches etc. 
Toavoid burning of circuit components safety devices like 
‘fuse’, circuit breakers etc. are used to open the circuit. 
 (Figs 9a & 9b). 
 For a fuse to protect a parallel circuit, itshould be placed

Laws of resistance and various types of resistors 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the laws of resistance, compare resistances of different materials 
*   state the relationship between the resistance and diameter of a conductor 
*   calculate the resistance and diameter of a conductor from the given data (i.e. dimensions etc.) 
*   explain various types of resistors. 
Laws of resistance: The resistance R   offered by a conduc- 
tor depends on the following factors. 
«   Theresistance ofthe conductor varies directly with its 
length. 
*   Theresistance of the conductor isinversely proportional 
to its cross-sectional area. 
*   Theresistance ofthe conductor depends onthe material 
with which it is made of. 
*   lt also depends onthe temperature of the conductor. 
Ignoring the last factor for the time being,we can say that 
where ''p’ (rho-Greek alphabet) - isa constant depending 
onthe nature ofthe material of the conductor, andis known 
as its specific resistance or resistivity. 
If the   length   is   one   metre   and the   area,   ‘a’   =   1   m’, 
then R =r. 
Hence, specific resistance of a material may be definedas 
‘the resistance betweenthe opposite faces of   ametre cube 
of that material’. (or, sometimes, the unit cube is taken in 
centimetre cube of that material) (Fig 1).

 Hence   the   unit   of   specific   resistance   is   onm   metre

Comparison of the resistance of different materials: 
Fig 2 gives some relative   idea   of the more important 
materials as conductors of electricity. All the conductors 
shown have the same cross-sectional area and the same 
amount of resistance. The silver wire   is the longest while 
that of copper is slightly short and that of aluminium is 
shorterstill. The silverwire is   more than Stimes longerthan 
the steel wire.

THE CONDUCTANCE OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS  ELN149612 
 Since different metals have different conductance ratings, 
they   must also   have   different   resistance   ratings.   The 
resistance ratings ofthe different metals can be found by 
experimenting with a standard piece of each metal in an 
electric circuit.   If you cut a piece of each of the more 
common metals to a standard size, and then connect the 
pieces to a battery, one at a time, you would find that 
different amounts of current would flow. (Fig 3)

 The   bar graph   (Fig 4)   shows the   resistance of some 
common metals as compared to copper. Silver is a better 
conductor than copper because it has less resistance.

 So that   p   = Ra+Lohm/ meter 
where p (greek letter,   pronounced ''rho'') represents the 
constant. 
L is the length of the wire in metres 
a is the area in square metres. 
Ve can reduce allthis into a simple statement: the larger 
the   wire,   the   lower   its   resistacne;   the   smaller   cross 
sectional area of the wire, the higher its resistance. 
We can summarize with the universal rule: the electrical 
resistance ofany metallic conductor is inversely proportional 
to its cross-sectional area. 
Objective: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the construction and characteristics of various types of resistors 
Resistors : These arethe most common passive component 
used in electrical and electronic circuits.   A resistor is 
manufactured with a specific value of ohms (resistance). 
The purpose of using a resistor in circuit is either to limit the 
current to a specific value or to provide a desired voltage 
 drop (IR}.   The power rating of resistors may be from 
 fractional walts to hundreds of VVatts. 
There are five types of resistors

 Wire-wound resistors 
 Wire-wound resistors are manufactured by using resist- 
ance wire (nickel-chrome alloy called Nichrome) wrapped 
around an insulating core,   such as ceramic porcelain, 
bakelite pressed paper etc.   Fig 1,   shows this type of 
resistor.   Wire wound resistors are used for high current 
application. They areavailablein wattage ratingsfromone 
 watt to   100 watts or more.

 Fixed resistors : The fixed resistors is one inwhichthe is 
 nominal value of resistance Is fixed.   These resistors are 
 provided with pair of leads. (Fig 1 to 4} 
Variable resistors (Fig 5) : Variable resistors are those 
whose values canbe changed. Variable resistors includes 
those components in which the resistance value can be set 
at the different levels with the help of sliding contacts. 
These are known as potentio meter resistors or simply as 
a potentio meters. 
Resistance   depends   upon   temperature,   voltage, 
light : Special resistors are also produced whose resist- 
ance varies with temperature, voltage, and light.

Tolerance value : The fourth band (tolerance) indicates 
the resistance range within which is the actual value falls. 
Inthe above example, the tolerance is +5%. +5% of 27000

value between 25650 ohms and28350 ohms. The resistors 
 with lower value of tolerance (precision) are costlier than 
 normal value of resistors.

 Measurementof resistances 
 Medium resistances could be measured by instruments 
like Kelvin’s bridge, Wheatstone bridge, Slide wire bridge, 
Post Office box and Ohmmeter. 
However, for measuring high resistances, instruments like 
megohmmeter ormegger are used. 
 Ohmmeter 
 The ohmmeter is an instrumentthatis usedfor measuring 
resistance. There are two types of ohmmeters: the series 
ohmmeter is used for measuring mediumresistances and

Before using an   ohmmeter in a circuit, for resistance 
measurement, the current in the circuit must be switched 
off and also any electrolytic capacitor in the circuit should 
be discharged. Remember that the chmmeter has its own 
source of supply. 
Series type ohmmeter: construction 
A   series   type   ohmmeter   shown   in   Fig   1   essentially 
consists ofa PMMC (Permanent magnet moving coil) (‘d’ 
Arsonval) mevement ‘M'', a limiting resistance R, and a 
battery ‘E’ and a pair of terminals A and B to which the 
unknown resistance ‘R,’ is to be connected. The shunt 
 resistance R, connected in parallel to meter ‘M’ is used for 
 adjusting the zero position of the pointer.

 Working 
Whenthe terminals Aand Bare shorted (unknown resistor 
R,= zero), maximumcurrentflows inthe circuit. The meter 
is made to read full scale current (I,.,)by adjusting the shunt 
resistance R,. The full scale current position of the pointer 
is marked zero(0) ohm cn the scale. 
When the chmmeter leads (A & Bterminals) are open, no 
current flows through the meter movement. Therefore, the 
meter does not deflect and the pointer remains in the left 
hand side of the dial. The left side of the cialis markedas 
infinity (oc ) resistance which means that there is infinite 
resistance (open circuit) between the test leads. 
Intermediate marking may be placed inthe dial (scale) by 
connecting different known valuesof R,, tothe instrument 
 terminals A and B. 
 The accuracy of the onmmeter depends greatly upon the 
condition of the battery. The voltage of the internal battery 
may decrease gradually due to usage or storage time. As 
such the full scale current drops and the meter does not 
read zero when the terminals A and B   are shorted. 
Thevariable shuntresistor R, inFig 1 providesanadjustment 
to counteract the effect of reduced battery voltage within 
certain limits. If the battery voltage falls below a certain 
value,   adjusting   R,   may not bring the   pointer to zero 
position, andhence, the battery should be replaced witha 
good one. 
As shown in Fig 2, the meter scale will be marked zero 
ohms at the right end and infinity ohms at the left end.

 This ohmmeter has a non-linear scale because of the 
inverse relationship between resistance andcurrent. This 
results in an expanded scale near the zero end and a 
crowded scale at the infinity end. 
Shunt type ohmmeter 
Fig3 shows the circuit diagram of a   shunttype ohmmeter. 
Inthis   meter the battery ‘E’ is in series with the zero ohm, 
adjustment resistor R, andthe PMMC meter movement. 
 The unknown resistance R, whichis connected across the 
terminals   Aand Bformsa   parallel circuit withthe meter. To 
 avoid draining ofthe battery during storage, the switch Sis 
of a spring-loaded, push-button type.

 Working 
Vvhen the terminals A and B are shorted (the unknown 
 resistance R,=   zero ohm), the meter current is zero. On 
 the other hand ifthe unknown resistance R= « = (keeping 
Aand Bopen) the currentflows only through the meter, and 
by proper selectionofthe value R,, the pointercan be made 
 to read its full scale. 
 The shunttype ohmmeter, therefore, has the zero markat 
the left hand sice of the scale (no current) and the infinite 
mark at right hand side of the scale (full scale deflection 
current) as shown in Fig 4. When measuring the resistance 
ofthe intermediate values the current flow dividesina   ratio 
inversely proportional to the meter resistance and the 
unknown   resistance.   Accordingly the   pointer takes an 
intermediate position. 
 Use 
 This type of ohmmeteris particularly suitable for measuring 
low value resistors.

Wheatstone bridge - principle and its application 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
 *   state wheats   tone bridge circuit,   construction, function and uses. 
 *   determine the unknown resistance by the wheatstone   bridge. 
For   determining   the   unknown   resistance   by 
Wheatstone Bridge 
=   The   current flowing through the bridge connection 
should be zero. 
 »   Thevalues of the other three resistances should be 
 precisely known. 
How to find no   current flaws through the   bridge 
 connection ?:An instrument, that can indicate the flaw of 
 evenafew micro amperes (millionth of an ampere), called 
galyanameter igused,   There are gab anometersthatgive 
full scale deflection for 25 microamperes. 
Inthe professional VWwheatstone bridges the galanometer 
isprovided with ap arallelresistance and switch. The bridge 
connection igmade only by pressing a push button. T his 
enables the user to check a momentary deflection ofthe 
 meter. Inthe case of excessive deflection, adjustment of 
 the variableresistor is done. Final and precise adjustment 
of the variable resistance   is made   keeping   the shunt 
resistorofthe galy anometerapen. 
The three   arms of the bridge   are   made   of standard? 
precision resistors. The contact resistance is kept very 
very low to increase the accuracy of the measurement 
made bythe Vwheatstone bridge, 
 In short, the use of the galvanometer isto ensure thatthe 
 current through the bridge connection is zero, te. both 
parallelbranches have equipotentialpoints connected by 
the bridge connector. 
This arrangement isnamed afterits inventarand is called 
the Wheatstone Bridge. 
The VWheatstone Bridge is used for measurements inthe 
range of about1.O ohmto 1.0 megohm.In Fig 1, resistars

 Effect of variation of temperature on   resistance 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain on what factors electrical resistance of   a conductor depends 
*   state the temperature co-efficient of resistance. 
The resistance of material largely depends on temperature 
and varies according to the material. 
When resistance ris a constant depending on the nature 
of the material of the conductor and known as its specific 
resistance or resistivity.   Dependency of resistance on 
temperature is explained in detail below :- 
Effect   of temperature   on   resistance:   Actually,   the 
relative values of resistance thatwere givenearlierapply to 
the metals when they are at about room temperature.   At 
higherorlowertemperatures, the resistances of all materials 
change. 
Inmostcases,   whenthe temperature of a material goes up, 
its resistance goes uptoo. Butwith some other materials, 
increased temperature causesthe resistance to go down. 
The amount by which the resistance is affected by each 
degree of temperature change is called the temperature 
coefficient. And the words positive and negative are used 
to show whether the resistance goes up or down with the 
temperature. 
When the resistance ofthe material goes upastemperature 
is increased, ithas a positive temperature coefficient.   Itis 
appropriate in the case of pure metals such as silver, 
copper, aluminium, brass etc. (Fig 1)

 In the case of certain alloys such as eureka, manganin, 
etc. increase inresistance due to increase in temperature 
is relatively less and irregular. 
Whena material''s resistance goes downas   the temperature 
is increased, it has a negative temperature coefficient. 
 (Fig 2) 
 This applies in the case of electrolytes, insulators such as 
paper, rubber, glass, mica etc. and partialconductors such 
as carbon.

 Temperature   coefficient   of   resistance   (a)   of 
 conductor: Leta metallic conductor, having aresistance 
 of Rat O°C, be heated to t°C and let its resistance at this 
 temperature be R,. Then, considering normal ranges of 
temperature,   it is found that the increase in resistance 
depends:

 *   directly on tts initial resistance

Hence   (R.-   Ri) =R toe   22 2 2   (i) 
where o: (alpha) is constant andisknownas   the temperature 
coefficient of resistance of the conductor. 
Rearranging Eq. (i), we get

 IfR,=10,t=1°C, then a= AR=R-R,, 
 Hence, the temperature-coefficient of a material may be 
defined as: the change inresistance inohm per “Crise in 
temperature. 
From Eq.(i), we findthat R=   R.(l+at)   ..... (id) 
Inview of the dependence of monthe initial temperature, we 
may define the temperature coefficient of resistance at a 
giventemperature as the changeinresistance per ohmper 
degree centigrade change in temperature from the given 
temperature.

Series and   parallel combination   circuit 
 Objective: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   solve series-parallel circuit problems. 
Formation of series parallel circuit 
Apart fromthe series circuit and parallel circuits, the third 
type of circuit arrangement   isthe series-parallel circuit. In 
this circuit, there is at least one resistance connected in 
series   and   two   connected   in   parallel.   The   two   basic 
arrangements of the series-parallel circuitare shown here. 
Inone, resistor, andR., are connected in parallel and this 
parallel connection,   in turn,   is connected in series with 
resistance R,. (Fig 1)

 Thus, R, and R,, form the parallel component, and R, the 
series component of a series-parallel circuit.   The total 
resistance of any series-parallel circuit can be found by 
merely reducing itinto a simple series circuit. Forexample, 
the parallel portion of R, and R, can be reduced to an 
equivalentS-chm resistor(two 10-ohmresistors in parallel). 
Thenit has an equivalent circuit of a5-ohmresistor inseries 
with the   10-ohmresistor(R,), givinga total resistance of   15 
 ohms for the series-parallel combination. 
 A second basic series-parallel arrangement is shown in 
Fig 2 where basically   it has two branches of a parallel 
circuit.   However,   in   one   of the   branches   it   has two 
resistances inseriesR,andR,. Tofindthe total resistance 
 of this series -parallel circuit, first combine R, and R, into 
 an equivalent 20-ohm resistance. The total resistance is 
then 20 ohms in parallel   with 10 ohms, or 6.67 ohms. 
Combination circuits 
Aseries-parallel combination appears to be very complex. 
However, asimple solutionis   to break down the circuit into 
series/or parallel groups, and while solving problems, each 
 72 
 may be dealt with individually. Each group may be replaced 
by one resistance, having the value equal to the sumof all 
resistances. 
Each parallel group may be replaced by one resistance 
value equivalentto the combined resistance ofthat group. 
Equivalent circuits are to be prepared for determining the 
current, voltage and resistance for each component.

 Application 
Series-parallel circuits can be used to forma non-standard 
resistance value which is not available inthe market and 
can be used in the voltage divider circuits.

Magnetic terms,   magnetic material and   properties of magnet 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the different kinds of magnets and state the classification of magnetic material 
¢   State the classifications of magnets. 
Magnetism and magnets: Magnetismisa force thatacts 
on some materials and not on other materials. Physical 
devices which possess this force are called magnets. 
Magnets attract iron and steel, and when free to rotate, 
they will move to a fixed position relative to the north pole. 
Classification of magnets 
Magnets are classified into two groups. 
*   Natural magnets 
«   Artificial magnets 
Lodestone (an iron compound) is a natural magnet which 
was discovered centuries ago. (Fig 1) 
 Fig 1 
 ELN154314  LODESTONE 
 There are two types of artificial magnets. Temporary and 
permanent magnets. 
Temporary magnets or electromagnets: If a piece of 
magnetic material,   say,   soft iron is placed   in a strong 
 magnetic field of a solenoid it becomes magnetised by 
 induction.   The   soft   iron   itself   becomes   a   temporary 
magnet as long as the current continues to flow in the 
solenoid. As soon as the source producing the magnetic 
field is removed, the soft iron piece will loose its magnetism. 
Permanent magnets: If steel is substituted for soft ironin 
the same inducing fieldas inthe previous case, dueto the 
residual magnetism, the steel will become a permanent 
magneteven afterthe magnetising field is removed. This 
property   of   retention   is   termed   retentiveness.   Thus, 
permanent magnets are made from steel, nickel, alnico, 
tungsten all of which have higher retentiveness. 
Classification of magnetic substances 
Materials can be classified into three groups as follows. 
Ferromagnetic substances: Those substances which 
are   strongly   attracted   by   a   magnet   are   known   as 
ferromagnetic substances. Some examples are iron, nickel, 
cobalt, steel and their alloys. 
Paramagnetic substances: Those substances whichare 
slightly attracted by   a magnet of common strength are 
called   paramagnetic   substances.   Their attraction   can 
easily   be   observed with   a   powerful   magnet.   In short, 
paramagnetic substances are   similar   in   behaviour to 
ferromagnetic materials. Some examples are aluminium, 
manganese, platinum, copper etc. 
Diamagnetic substances: Those substances whichare 
slightly repelled by a magnet of powerful strength only are 
known as diamagnetic substances. Some examples are 
bismuth,   sulphur,   graphite,   glass,   paper,   wood,   etc. 
Bismuth is the strongest of the diamagnetic substances. 
There is no substance which can be properly 
called non-magnetic. It may also be noted that 
water is a diamagnetic material, and air is a 
paramagnetic substance. 
 Magnetic terms and properties   of   magnet 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   define the terms magnetic field, magnetic line, magnetic axis, magnetic neutral axis and unit pole 
*   explain the properties of   a magnet 
*   state the application, care and maintenance of a permanent magnet. 
Magnetic fields: The force of magnetismis referred to as 
a magnetic field. This field extends out from the magnet in 
alldirections, as illustrated in Fig 1. Inthis figure, the lines 
extending fromthe magnet represent the magnetic   field. 
The space around a magnet in which the influence of the 
magnet can be detected Is called the magnetic field. 
Magnetic lines: Magnetic lines of force (flux) areassumed 
to be continuous loops, the flux lines continuing on through 
the magnet. They do not stop at the poles.

 Magnetic axis: The imaginary line joining the two poles 
of a magnet are called the magnetic axis.   It is also known 
as the magnetic equator. 
Magnetic neutral axis (Fig2): The imaginary lines which 
are perpendicular to the magnetic axis and pass through 
the centre of the magnet are called the magnetic neutral 
axis.

 Unit pole: A unit pole may be defined as that pole which, 
when placed one metre apart from an equal and similar 
pole, repels it with a force of 10 newtons. 
Properties of   a magnet 
The following are the properties of magnets. 
Attractive   property   :   A   magnet   has the   property   of 
attracting magnetic substances (such as iron, nickel and 
cobalt) and its power of attraction is greatest at its poles. 
 (Fig 3)

 BAR MAGNET  ELN154923 
 Directive property: If a magnet is freely suspended, its 
poles will always tend to set themselves in the direction of 
north and south. (Fig 4) 
Induction property:   A magnethasthe propertly of producing 
magnetism ina nearby magnetic substance by induction.

ELN154325 SOFT IRON PROVIDES A PATH FOR   MAGNETIC LINES OF FORCE. 
 Demagnetising property: Ifa magnetis handled roughly 
by heating, hammering, etc. It will lose its magnetism. 
Property of strength: Every magnet has two poles. The 
two poles of a magnet have equal pole strength. 
Saturation property: If   a magnet of higher strength is 
further subjected to magnetization,   it will never acquire 
more magnetization due to its being already saturated. 
Property of attraction and repulsion: Unlike poles (i.e. 
north and south) attract each other, (Fig6) while like poles 
(north/north and south/south) repel each other. (Fig 7)

Methods   of magnetizing:   There   are   three   principal 
methods of magnetizing a material. 
 *   Touchmethod 
 *   By means of electric current 
 *   Induction method, 
 Touch method: This method can be further   divided   into: 
*   single touch method 
*   double touch method, and 
Single touch method: In the single touch method, the 
steel bar to be magnetizedis rubbed witheither of the poles 
ofa magnet, keeping the other pole away fromit. Rubbing 
isdone only inone direction as shown inFig3. The process 
should be repeated many times for inducing magnetization 
of the bar. 
 Fig 8   ae 
 STEEL BAR  ELN15432D 
 Double touch method: In this method the steel bar to be 
magnetized is placed over the two opposite pole endsofa 
magnet, andthe rubbing magnets are placed together over 
the centre of the bar witha small wooden piece inbetween, 
as showninFig9. They are never lifted offthe surface ofthe 
steel bar, but rubbed again and again from end to end, 
finally ending atthe centre where the rubbing was started. 
 Fig 9 
 ELN15432E  DOUBLE-TOUCH METHOD 
 Divided touch method:   Here the two different poles ofthe 
rubbing magnets are placedas inthe previouscase. They 
are then moved along the surface of the steel bar to the 
opposite ends. The rubbing magnets are then   lifted offthe 
surface of the steel bar and placed back inthe centre of the 
bar. The whole process is repeated again and again as 
shown in Fig 10. 
The steel bar thus magnetized becomes a permanent 
magnet but the degree of magnetization Is very low. 
 Fig 10 
 ELN15432F  DIVIDED-TOUCH METHOD 
 By electric current: The bar to be magnetized is wound 
with an insulated copper wire, and then a strong electric 
current (DC) froma   battery is passed through the wire for 
sometime. The steel bar then becomes highly magnetized. 
The magnet made by such an arrangement is called an 
 electromagnet and   is generally   used   in   laboratories. 
(Fig 11)

 ELN154326, 
o =  Induction   method:   This   is   a   commercial   method 
making permanent magnets. Inthis methoda pole charger 
is used which has a coil of many turns and an iron core 
inside it as shown in Fig 12.   The direct current supply is 
fed to the coil through a push-button switch. 
The steel piece to be magnetized is placed onthe ironcore 
kept inside the coil, and direct current is passed through 
the coil. The iron core now becomes a powerful magnet.

Electromagnetism: On passing acurrentthrough a coil of 
wire,   amagneticfieldis set up aroundthe coil. Ifasoftiron 
baris placed inthe coil of wire carrying the current, the iron 
bar   becomes   magnetized.   This   process   is   known   as 
“electromagnetism. The softiron bar remains asa magnet 
as long as the current is flowing in the circuit. It loses its 
magnetism when the current is switched off from the coil. 
The   polarity   of this   electromagnet depends   upon the 
direction of the current flowing through it. If the direction 
of the current is altered, the polarity of the magnetic field 
will also be changed as shown in Fig 1.

 The right hand grip rule can be used to determine the 
direction of the magnetic field.   If you wrap your fingers 
around the wire with your thumb pointing In the direction 
of current flow, your fingers   will point inthe directionofthe 
magnetic field as shown in Fig 2.

DIRECTION OF MAGNETIC LINES ELNiS4414 
 Assume a right handed corkscrew to be along the wire 
so asto advance inthe direction ofthe current. The motion 
ofthe handle gives the direction of magnetic lines of force 
around the conductor (Fig 3) 
The direction of the   magnetic field can be found from right 
hand palm rule (Fig 4} 
The Right Hand Palm Rule: Hold the right hand palm 
over the solenoid in such a way the fingers point in the 
direction of current in the solenoid conductors then the 
thumb indicates the direction of magnetic field (North Pale} 
of the solenoid.

 Magnetic   materials   for   temporary   magnets: 
Electromagnets are generally known astemporary magnets. 
The magnetic strength of such magnets can be varied by 
varying the current passing throughthem. Soft ironis used 
inelectromagnetsasa magnetic core. Siliconsteelisvery 
much used in bigger magnets (steel with 2.4% silicon). 
Nowadays other metals like permalloy, mumetal are also 
used for some applications. 
Permalloy is an alloy of iron and nickel which can   be 
magnetized by a very weak magnetic   field and is useful for 
telephones. 
Mumetal is an alloy of nickel, copper, chromium and iron.

The magnetic circuits - self and mutually induced emfs 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   define the magnetic terms in a magnetic circuit (like M.M.F., reluctance, flux, field strength, flux density, 
permeability, relative permeability) 
*   state hysterisis. 
MagnetoMotive Force (MMF): The amountof flux density 
set up in the core is dependent upon five factors - the 
current, number of turns, material of the magnetic core, 
length of core and the cross-sectional area of the core. 
More current and the more turns of wire we   use,   the 
greater will be the magnetising effect. Wve call this product 
of the turns and current the magnetomotive force (mmf), 
similar to the electromotive force (emf). 
MMF   =   Nlampere-turns 
wheremmf   -   isthe magnetomotive force inampere 
turns 
N   -   isthe number of   turns wrapped on 
the core 
-   is the current in the coil, in amperes, 
A. 
lfone ampere current is flowing through a coil having 200 
turns then the mmf is 200 ampere turns. 
Reluctance: In the magnetic circuit there is something 
analogous to electrical resistance,   and is called reluc- 
tance, (symbol S). The total flux is inversely proportional 
to the reluctance and so if we denote mmf by ampere 
turns. we can write 
 NI 
 p= S   Where o   is flux and reluctances   gs =   i 
 HoH;   a 
 where   S   - reluctance 
|   - length of the magnetic path in metres 
H,- permeability of free space 
. - relative permeability 
a   - cross-sectional area of the magnetic path in 
 sq.mm. 
 The unit of reluctance is ampere turnsA/Vb. 
Magnetic flux:Tne magnetic flux ina magnetic circuit is 
equal   to   the   total   number   of   linés   existing   on   the 
cross-section of the magnetic core at right angle to the 
direction of the flux.   Its symbol is @ and the SI   unit is 
 weber. 
 Nilay uy,

 where 
@   - total flux 
N-number of turns 
|   - current in amperes 
 Ss   -feluctance 
 H,   - permeability of free space 
H.   - relative permeability 
a   - magnetic path cross-sectional area in m? 
é   - length of magnetic path in metres. 
Flux density (B): The total number of lines of force per 
square metre of the cross- sectional area of the magnetic 
core   is called flux density,   and   is represented by the 
symbol B. Its SI unit (in the MKS system) is tesla (weber 
per metre square). 
B   =   &   Weber! m? 
 A 
 where @ - total flux in webers 
A   -area of the core in square metres 
B   -flux density in weber/metre square. 
Permeability: The permeability of a magnetic material is 
defined asthe ratio of flux created inthat material to the flux 
created in air, provided that mmf and dimensions of the 
magnetic circuit remain the same. It''s symbol is yu and 
 = B/H 
 where B   is the flux density 
H is the magnetising force. 
Being a ratio it has no unit and it is expressed as a mere 
number. The permeability of air U air= unity. The relative 
permeability ur of iron and steel ranges from 50 to 2000. 
The permeability of   a given material varies with its flux 
density. 
Hysteresis: Consider the graphical relation between B 
and   H   for   a   magnetic   material.   Since   p   =   B/H,   the

increases and there will be an increase in the flux density, 
 B. Since the number of turns and the length of core of a 
coil are fixed, H is directly proportional to the current or 
 ammeter reading. The flux density can be measured by 
 inserting the probe of a flux meter into a small hole drilled 
in the core. 
A   plot   of   the   values   of   B   and   H   gives   the   normal 
magnetization curve, as shown in Fig 1. There is evidently 
a linear portion where B is relatively proportional to H. But 
 then a condition of saturation occurs when a very large 
 increase in H is required to significantly increase B. This 
paint in the curve is called as saturation point. 
If the current is now gradually reduced towards zero, H 
returns   to   zero,   but   B   does   not.   The   core   exhibits 
retentiveness and retains some residual magnetism. The 
 retentiveness is represented by the distance OR.

 Ifthe connections to the coil are reversed, andthe current 
 is again increased, itis found thata certain amount of His 
 required to bring the magnetism inthe core down to zero. 
This is called the coercivity and is represented by the 
distance OC. 
Further, any increase inthe currentin the opposite direction 
increases the   magnetism in the core as before in the 
opposite direction, until once again saturation occurs.

Practical   applications   of   electromagnets: 
Electromagnets are used inthe manufacture of all types of 
electrical   machines,   such   as   motors,   generators, 
transformers,   convertors,   some   electrical   measuring 
instruments, protective relays, for medical purposes (like 
removing iron pieces from eyes) and inmany other electrical 
devices   like   bells,   buzzers,   circuit-breakers,   relays, 
telegraphic circuits, lifts and other industrial uses.

Faraday’s Laws of Electromagnetic Induction are also 
applicable for conductors carrying alternating current. 
Faradays’ Laws of Electromagnetic Induction 
Faraday’s First Law states that whenever the magnetic 
flux is linked with a circuit changes,   an emf is always 
induced in it. 
The   Second   Law states   that   the   magnitude   of the 
induced emf is equal to the rate of change of flux linkage. 
Dyanamically Induced EMF 
Accordingly incuced emf can be produced either by moving 
the conductor ina stationery magnetic field or by changing 
magnetic flux over a stationery conductor. Whenconductor 
moves and produces emf, the emfiscalledas dynamically 
induced emf Ex. generators. 
Statically Induced EMF 
When changing flux produces emf the emf is called as 
statically   induced   emf   as   explained   below. 
Ex: Transformer. 
Statically induced emf: VWWhenthe induced emfis produced 
ina stationery conductor due to changing magnetic field, 
obeying Faraday’s laws of electro magnetism, the induced 
emf is called as statically induced emf. 
There are two types of statically induced emf as stated 
below :- 
1   Self induced emf produced with in the same coil 
2   mutually induced emf produced inthe neighbouring 
 coil 
 Self-induction: The productionofanelectromotive force in 
a circuit, when the magnetic flux linked with the circuit 
 Counter   emf   -   inductive   reactance 
 changes as a result of the change in a current inducing in 
the same circuit. 
According to Faraday’s Laws, an emf is induced in the 
conductor.   Similarly, when the magnetic field collapses, 
the flux lines cut through the conductor again, and an emf 
is induced once again. This is called self-induction. 
Mutual   Inductance:   VWhen   two   or   more   coils   one 
magnetically linked together by   a common magnetic flux, 
they are said to have the property of mutual inductance. It 
is the basic operating principal of the transformer, motor 
generaters and any otherelectricalcomponentthat interacts 
with another magneticfield. It candefine mutual induction 
onthe current flowing in one coil that induces a voltage in 
an adjacement coil. 
Inductance: Inductance (L) is the electrical property of an 
electrical circuit or device to oppose any change in the 
 magnitude of current flow in a circuit. 
 Devices which are used to provide inductance in a circuit 
are called inductors. Inductors are also knownas chokes, 
coils, and reactors. Inductors are usually coils of wire. 
Factors determining inductance: The inductance of an 
inductor is primarily determined by four factors. 
*   Type of core permeability of the core m, 
*   Number of turns of wire in the coil ‘N’. 
*   Spacing between turns of wire (Spacing factor). 
*   Cross-sectional area (diameter ofthe coil core) ‘a’or''d’. 
Henry: Aconductor or coil has aninductance of one henry 
if   a current that changes at the rate of oné ampere per 
second produces a induced voltage (cemf) of 1 volt. 
Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the term Counter EMF (CEMF) 
*   explain about the inductive reactance 
*   State the reasons for the difference between ohmic resistance and impedance of a coil. 
Counter EMF and LENZ’s law: The voltage induced ina 
conductor or coil by its own magnetic field is called a 
counter electromotive force (cemf}. Since the induced emf 
(voltage) is always opposing, or countering, the action of 
the   source   voltage,   it   is   known   as   cemf.   Counter 
electromotive force   is sometimes   referred to as back 
electromotive force (bemf). 
In any type of inductive   circuit there   is   an   important 
relationship between the direction of the current change 
and the induced voltage.   Lenz’s law states that a cemf 
always has a polarity which opposes the force that created 
 it. 
 The inductance rating of an inductor refers to its ability to 
generate a counter voltage to a change incurrentflow. One 
henry (1H- the SI unit) represents the inductance of a coil 
inwhich acurrent change of one ampere persecond (1 A/ 
s) will produce a cemf of one volt (1). 
Inductive reactance: The opposition offered to an AC 
current flow by the   inductive effect   is called   inductive 
reactance.   Inductive reactance is the result of the cemf of 
the inductor. 
Eddy currents are caused by voltages induced into the 
conductors and other surrounding metal parts.   They are 
directly proportional to the frequency of the supply.   The 
heat produced by these currents tends to increase the 
effective resistance of the circuit. 
Effect of inductance presentin aAC circuit: Coils have 
various uses in electrical engineering such as 
*   excitation coils in electric machines or magnets

Capacitor is a passive two terminal electrical/electranic 
component that stores potential   energy in the form of 
electrostatic fleld 
Theettect ofcapacitoris calledas capacitance. It consists 
of two   conducting   plates   separated   by   an   insulating 
material   called   as dielectric. In   simple, capacitor is a 
device designed to store electric charge. 
Construction:   “4   capacitor   ic   an   electrical   device 
consisting ofto parallel conductive plates separated hy 
an insulating material called the dielectric. Connecting 
leads are attached tothe parallel plates. (Fig 1)

Ceramic capacitors Ceramic dielectrics provide very 
high dielectric constants (1200 is typical).   As a result, 
comparatively high capacitance values canke achieved

 Mica capacitors are available with capacitance values 
ranging from 1 pF te 0.1   pF andvoltgage ratings from 100 
 to 2500 V DC. 
 Electrolytic   capacitors:   Electrolytic   capacitors   are 
polarised   so that one   plate   is   positive   and   the   other 
negative. 
These capacitors are used for high capacitance values up 
toover 200,000u F, butthey have relatively low breakdown 
voltages (350 V is a typical maximum) and high amounts 
of leakage. 
Electrolytic capacitors are available intwotypes: aluminium 
and tantalum. The basic construction of an electrolytic 
capacitor is shown in Figs 2(e) and (f).

 Paper/plastic capacitors: There are several types of 
plastic-film   capacitors   and   the   older   paper   dielectric 
capacitors.   Polycarbonate,   parylene,   polyester, 
polystyrene, polypropylene, mylar, and paper are some of 
the more common dielectric materials used.   Some of 
these types have capacitance values up to   100UF. 
Fig 3a show a common basic construction used in many 
plastic-film   and   paper   capacitors.   Fig   3b   shows   a 
construction view for one type of plastic-film capacitor. 
Variable capacitors 
Variable capacitors are used in a circuit when there is a 
need to acjust the capacitance value either manually or 
automatically.   For example, in radio or TV tuners. The 
major types of variable or adjustable capacitors are now 
discussed. 
Air capacitor: Variable capacitors with air dieléctrics, 
suchas the one showninFig4(b), are sometimes usedas 
tuning   capacitors   in   applications   requiring   frequency 
selection.   This type of capapcitor is constructed with 
several plates that mesh together.   One set of plates can 
be moved relative to the other, thus changing the effective 
 plate area and the capacitance. The movable plates are 
 linked together mechanically so that they move when a 
shaft is rotated.

 Grouping   of capacitors 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the necessity of grouping capacitors and method of connection 
*   state the conditions for connecting capacitors in parallel and in series 
*   explain the values of capacitance and voltage in parallel and series combination 
Necessity of grouping   of capacitors:   In   certain   in- 
stances, we may not be able to get a required value of 
capacitance and a required voltage   rating.   In such in- 
stances, to get the required capacitances from the avail- 
able capacitors and to give only the safe voltage across 
capacitor,   the capacitors have to be grouped in different 
fashions. Such grouping of capacitors is very essential.

CAPACITORS IN PARALLEL 
 Methods of grouping: There aretwo methods of grouping. 
*   Parallelgrouping  ELN154941 
 *   Series grouping   General formula for parallel capacitance: The total 
 capacitance of parallel capacitors is found by adding the 
individual capacitances.

 Parallel grouping 
 Conditions for parallel grouping 
*   Voltage rating of capacitors should be higher than the 
supply voltage Vs. 
 *   Polarity should be maintained in the case of polarised   C,,C,,C, etc. are the parallel capacitors. 
 capacitors (electrolytic capacitors).   The voltage applied to a parallel group must not exceed 
 the lowest breakdown voltage for all the capacitors in the 
parallel group. 
where C_ is the   total capacitance, 
Necessity of parallel grouping: Capacitors are con- 
nected in parallel to achieve a higher capacitance than 
 what is available in one unit. 
 Connection of parallel grouping: Parallel grouping of 
capacitors   is shown   in Fig   1   and is analogous to the 
connection of resistance in parallel or cells in parallel. 
Total capacitance: VVhen capacitors are connected in 
parallel, the total capacitance is the sum   ofthe individual 
capacitances, because the effective plate area increases. 
The calculation oftotal parallel capacitance is analogous 
to the calculation of total resistance of a series circuit. 
Example:   Suppose three capacitors are connected in 
parallel, where two have a breakdown voltage of 250 V 
and one has a breakclown voltage of 200 V,   then the 
maximum voltage   that   can   be   applied to   the   parallel 
group   without damaging any capacitor is 200 volts.

Series grouping 
 Necessity of grouping of capacitors in series: The 
necessity of grouping capacitors inseries is to reduce the 
total capacitance inthe circuit. Another reason is thattwo 
or   more   capacitors   in   series   can withstand   a   higher 
potential difference than anindividual capacitor. 
Conditions for series grouping 
-   If different voltage rating capacitors have to be con- 
nected in series, take care to see that the voltage drop 
across each capacitor is less than its voltage rating. 
-   Polarity should be maintained in the case of polarised 
capacitors. 
Connection   in   series   grouping:   Series   grouping   of 
capacitors,   as   shown   in   Fig   3   is   analogous   to   the 
connection of resistances in series or cells in series.

 SERIES CONNECTION OF CAPACITORS  ELN( 4944 
 Total capacitance:Vvhen capacitors are connected in 
series,   the total capacitance   is less than the smallest 
capacitance value, because 
*   the effective plate separation thickness increases 
*   andthe effective plate area Is limited by the smaller 
plate. 
The calcualtion oftotal series capacitance is analogousto 
the calculation of total resistance of parallel resistors. 
General   formula for   series   capacitance:   The total

Maximum voltage across each capacitor:   In series 
grouping, the division of the applied voltage among the 
capacitors depends on the individual capacitance value 
according to the formula 
The largest value capacitor will have the smallest voltage 
because of the reciprocal relationship. 
Likewise, the smallest capacitance value will   have the 
largestvoltage. 
The voltage across any individual capacitor in a series 
connection can be determined using the following for- 
mula. 
 Cy 
 x 
 where   V.,- individual voltage of each capacitor 
C,- individual capacitance of each capacitor 
V. - supply voltage. 
The potential   difference does not divide equally if the 
capacitances are unequal. Ifthe capacitances are unequal 
you must be careful notto exceed the breakdown voltage 
of any capacitor.

Alternating current - terms & definitions - vector diagrams 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the features of direct current 
list out the advantages of DC over AC 
*   compare the features of DC and AC 
*   explain the generation of alternating current and terms used 
*   State the advantages of AC over DC. 
Directcurrent (DC): Electric current can be definedasthe 
flow of electrons ina circuit. Based onthe electrontheory, 
electrons flow from the negative (-) polarity to the positive 
(+) polarity of a voltage source. 
Direct current (DC) is the current that flows only in one 
direction in a circuit. (Fig 1) The current in this type of 
circuit is supplied from a DC voltage source. Since the 
polarity ofa DC source remainsfixed, the current produced 
by it flows in one direction only. 
Advantages of DC over AC 
 ll   DC   needs only two wires of transmission,   while a 
3 phase AC may need upto 4 wires. 
The corona loss associated with DC is negligible while 
 for AC it increases with its frequency. 
 The skin effect is also   observed   in   AC   leading to 
problems in transmission conductor designs.

circuit is one in which the direction and amplitude of the 
current flow change at regular intervals. The current in 
this type of circuit is supplied from an AC voltage source. 
The polarity ofan AC source changes at regular intervals 
resulting in a reversal of the circuit current flow. 
Alternating current usually changes in   both value and 
direction.   The   current   increases   from   zero   to   same 
maximum value, and then drops back to zero as it flows 
in one direction. This same pattern is then repeated as it 
flows in the   opposite direction.   The wave-form or the 
exact   manner   in   which   the   current   increases   and 
decreases   is   determined   by   the   type   of   AC   voltage 
source used. (Fig 2)

 Alternating current generation: Alternating current is 
used wherever a   large   amount   of electrical   power   is 
required. Almost all   of the electrical energy supplied for 
domestic and commercial purposes isalternating current. 
AC voltage is used because itis much easier and cheaper 
to generate, and whentransmitted overlong distances, the 
power loss is low. 
Alternating current can be generated at higher voltages 
than DC. Some standard values of voltages are 1.1KV, 
2.2.KV,3.3KVforlow capacity. The values are increased 
to 66000,   110000, 220000, 400 000 valtsfortransmission 
over   long distances.   At the   load area,   the voltage   is 
decreased to working values of 240V and 415V. 
Agenerator isa machine that uses magnetism to convert 
mechanical energy into electrical energy. The generator 
principle, simply stated, is that a voltage is induced ina 
conductor whenever the conductor is moved through a 
magnetic field so as to cut the lines of magnetic force. 
AnAC generator produces an AC voltage by causing aloop 
of wire to turn within a magnetic field. This relative motion 
between the wire and the magnetic field causes a voltage 
to be induced between the ends of the wire. This voltage 
changes in magnitude and polarity as the loop is rotated 
within the magnetic field. (Fig 3)

ELNIG0115 SIMPLIFIED AC GENERATOR 
 The force required to turn the loop can be obtained from 
various sources. For example, very large AC generators 
are turned by steam turbines   or by the movement of water. 
The AC voltage induced inthe armature coils is connected 
toasetof slip rings from which the external circuitreceives 
the voltage through a set of brushes. An electromagnet is 
used to produce a stronger magnetic field. 
The sine wave: The shape of the voltage wave-form 
generated by a coil rotating ina magnetic field is called a 
sine wave. The generated sine wave voltage varies in 
both voltage value and polarity. 
If the coil is rotated at a constant speed, the number of 
magnetic lines of force cut per second varies with the 
position ofthe coil. When the coil is moving parallel to the 
magnetic field, it cuts no lines of force. 
Therefore, no voltage is generated at this instant. Whenthe 
 coil is moving at right angles to the magnetic field, it cuts 
 the maximum number of lines of force. 
Therefore, maximum or peak voltage is generated at this 
instant.   Between these two points the voltage varies in 
accordance with the sine ofthe angle at which the coil cuts 
the lines of force. 
The coilis shown infive specific positions in Fig 4. These 
are intermediate positions which occur during one complete 
revolution of the coil position. The graph shows how the 
voltage increases and decreases in amount during one 
rotation of the loop. 
Notethatthe direction ofthe voltage reverses each half-cycle. 
This is because, foreach revolution ofthe coil, each side 
must first move down and then up through the field. 
The sine wave   is the   most basic and widely used AC 
wave-form. Thestandard AC generator (alternator) produces 
avoltage ofsine wave-form. Some ofthe important electrical 
characteristics and terms used when referring to AC sine 
wave voltage or currentare asfollows. 
Gycle: One cycle is one complete wave of alternating 
voltage or current. During the generation of one cycle of 
output voltage, there are two changes inthe polarity ofthe 
voltage. 
These equal but opposite halves of a complete cycle are 
referred to as alternations. The terms positive and negative 
are used to distinguish one alternation from the other. 
 (Fig) 
 Period: The time requiredto produce one complete cycle 
is called the period of the wave-form. InFig6, ittakes 0.25 
seconds to complete one cycle. Therefore, the period (T} 
of that wave-form   is 0.25 seconds. 
Frequency: The frequency of an AC sine wave is the 
number of cycles produced per second. (Fig 6) The unit of 
frequency is the hertz (Hz). For example, the 240V AC at 
your home has a frequency of 50 Hz.

 E   :   The peak value of a sine wave refers to the maximum 
zo   voltage or current value. Note that two equal peak values 
z   =   -   occur during   one cycle. 
 f   4   ‘ 
 3   Se   <s   See   =   Peak-to-peak value: The peak-to-peak value of a sine 
 2   wave refers to its total overall value from one peak to the 
 .-   a8   o78   other. (Fig 8) It is equal to two times the peak value. 
 I   a   2   Effective value: The effective value of an alternating 
CYCLE, PERIOD, AND FREQUENCY. THE WAVEFORM HAS A   I   F   =   5   * 
 PERIGD OF 0.25 SEGONDS AND FOUR CYCLES PER SECOND.   2   current is that value which will produce the same heating

 Instantaneous value: The value of analternating quantity 
at any particular instantis called instantaneous value. The 
instantaneous values of a sine wave voltage is shown in 
Fig /. Itis   3.1 volts at 1us, 7.07 V at 2.5us, 10V at Sus, 
OV at 10us, - 3.1 volt at 11 Us and so on. 
Peak value or maximum value: Each alternation of the 
sinewave is made up ofa numberof instantaneous values. 
These values are plotted at various heights above and 
below the horizontal line to form a continuous wave-form.

 effect as a specific value of asteady direct current. Inother 
words, an alternating current has an effective value of 1 
ampere, if it produces heat at the same rate as the heat 
produced by 1 ampere of direct current, bothflowinginthe 
same value of resistance. 
Another name for the effective value of an alternating 
current or voltage is the root mean square (rms) value.

 The instantaneous values for one cycle are selected for 
equal   periods of time.   Each value is squared,   and the 
average of the squares is calculated (values are squared 
because the heating effect varies as square of the current 
or voltage).   The   square root of this   is the   rms value.

 By using this method it can be proved that the effective 
value of a sine wave of current is always equal to 0.707 
times its peak value.   Asimple equation for calculating the 
effective value of sinewave is: 
for voltage,   V=0.707 V_. 
 for current,   |= 0.707 | 
 where subscript m refers to the maximum value. 
When an alternating current or voltage is specified, it is 
always the effective value OR RMS valve that is meant, 
unless otherwise stated.   Standard AC meters indicate 
effective values only. 
Average   value:   It   is   sometimes   useful   to   know   the 
average value for one half cycle.   Ifthe currentis changed 
at the same rate over   the entire half cycle as in Fig 10, the 
average value would be one half of the maximum value.

Advantages of AC over DC: 
1   AC voltages can be raised or lowered with ease. This 
makes it ideal for transmission purposes. 
2   Large amounts of power can be transmitted at high 
voltage and low currents with minimum loss. 
3   Because the currentis low,   smallertransmission wires 
can be used to reduce installation and maintenance 
costs. 
AC is easy to generate than DC. 
AC generators take higher efficiency than DC. 
6   Theloss of energy during transmission in negligible for 
AC in long distance. 
 f   The AC can be easily converted to DC. 
 It can easily stepup or stepdown using transformer. 
Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   describe the purpose of earthing 
*   describe the two types of earthing 
*   differentiate between ‘neutral’ and ‘earth wire’. 
Earthing: The importance of earthing lies inthe fact thatit 
deals with safety. One of the most important,   but least 
understood,   considerations   in the design   of electrical 
systems is that of earthing (grounding). The word earthing’ 
comes from the fact that the technique   itself involves 
making a low-resistance connection to the earth or to the 
ground. The earthcan be considerecdito be a large conductor 
which is at zero potential. 
Purpose ofearthing: The purpose of earthing isto provide

electrical system: earthing of one of the conductors ofthe 
wiring system, and earthing of all metal enclosures which 
contain electrical wires or equipment. The two types of 
earthingare: 
*   System earthing 
«   Equipmentearthing. 
System earthing: This consists of earthing one of the 
wires of the electrical system, such as the neutral, to limit 
the maximum voltage to earth under normal operating 
conditions. 
Equipment earthing: Thisisa permanent and continuous 
bondingtogether (i.e. connecting together) ofall non-current 
carrying metal   parts of the electrical equipment to the 
system earthing electrode. 
 What is an earthing electrode?: A metal plate, pipe or 
 other conductors electrically connected to the general 
mass of the earthis knownas anearthing electrode. Earth 
electrodes   shall   be   provided   at   generating   stations, 
 Use of vector diagram 
 substations and consumer premises (in accordance with 
the requirements of IS | 3043-1966). 
The neutral usedin single phase systemis to provide return 
path for load current to the source.   Various method of 
neutral earthing is provided to serve neutral insingle phase 
distribution at substation according to the requirements. 
What   is an ‘earth wire''?: A conductor   connected to 
earth and usually situated in proximity to the associated 
line conductors which is used for equipment earthing is 
called an earth wire. 
The purpose of equipment earthing: By connectingthe 
metal work not intended to carry currentto earth, a pathis 
provided forleakage current which can be detected, and, if 
necessary, interrupted by the following devices. 
 —   Fuses   —   Circuit breakers. 
 Objective: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   distinguish between scalar and vector quantity. 
Definition of scalar and vector quantity and phasor 
Scalar quantity:A scalar quantity is a quantity which is 
determined by the magnitude alone, for example energy, 
volume, temperature etc. 
Vector quantity: A vector quantity is a quantity which Is 
represented by straightline with an arrow head torepresent 
the magnitude and direction of it.   For example, - force, 
velocity, weight. 
Phasor: Phasor is a vector that is rotating at a constant 
angular velocity. Astraight line with   anarrow headis used 
to represent graphically the magnitude and phase of a 
sinusoidal alternating quantity (i.e. current, voltage and 
power) is called phasor. 
Use of vector diagrams: The change which occurs inthe 
value of analternating voltage and/or current during a cycle 
can also be shown by using vector diagrams. 
A vector is a line segment that has a define length and 
direction.   Avector diagram is two or more vectors joined 
together to convey information. Vector diagrams drawnto 
scale can be used to determine instantaneous values of 
current anc/or voltage. 
Scalar quantity   Vector quantity 
1. Scalar quantity can be presented by magnitude only, 
for example - energy, volume etc. 
2.   Addition and substraction of scalar quantities can 
be done algebraically 
Vector quantity   must represent magnitude and direction 
also, for example - force velocity etc. 
Addition and subtraction of vector quantities cannot be 
done algebracially but by vector summation. 
 AC simple circuit 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state phase relationship between voltage, current & power in pure resistance circuit 
*   state phase relationship between voltage, current & power in pure inductance circuit 
¢   state phase relationship between voltage, current & power in pure capacitance circuit. 
Pure resistance circuit: A pure resistance circuit is one 
possessing neither inductance nor capacitance. Hence, if 
a current passes through   the circuit. No back emf will be 
setup by any change in current. The applied voltage is 
requiredto overcome the ohmic droponly as inade circuit. 
So, we have, using effective values. 
 R 
 Since the current is proportional to the voltage, the wave

 The power in a pure resistance circuit is given by the

Circuit with pure inductance only 
Acircuit with pure inductance alone can never be formed, 
because the source, the connecting wires, andthe inductor 
all have some resistance. However, if these resistances 
are very smallandhave a muchsmallereffect onthe circuit 
current   than   does the   inductance,   the   circuit   can   be 
considered as containing only inductance. (Fig 2)

 Phase difference:   If two   alternating   quantities attain 
maximum value inthe same directionafter passingthrough 
zerovalue at differenttimes, they are saidto havea phase 
difference. 
Phase difference can be expressed infractions of a cycle. 
For more accuracy, phase difference is givenin degrees. 
Theterms ‘lead! and ‘lag’ are usedto describe the relative 
positions in time of two voltages or currents that are notin 
phase. The one that is ahead in time is said to lead, while 
the one behind lags. (Fig 3) 
When maximum and minimum points of one voltage or 
current occur before the corresponding points of another 
voltage or current, the two are outof phase. Vvhensucha 
phase difference exists, one of the voltages or currents 
leads, and the other lags. 
Phase relationship between current and voltage ina 
circuit with   inductance   only   : When AC voltage   is 
applied to an inductive circuit, the current lags behind the

 Inductive reactance:The cemf acts   just like a resistance 
to limit the current flow. But cemf is discussed in terms of 
volts, so it cannot be used in Ohm''s Law to compute the 
current. However, the effect of cemf can be giveninterms 
of ohms. This effect is called inductive reactance, and is 
abbreviatedas X,.   Since the cemf generated by aninductor 
is determined by the inductance (L) ofthe inductor, andthe 
frequency (f) of the current, the inductive reactance must 
also depend onthese things. The inductive reactance can 
be calculated by the equation 
 B= ail 
 where %, is the inductive reactance in ohms; f   is the 
 frequency ofthe currentincycles per second: andListhe 
inductance in henrys. The quantity 27 together actually 
represents the   rate of change of the   current,   usually

capacitor and this current is also positive. As long as the 
emf across the capacitor plates increases, current flows 
into the capacitor. 
When the instant L is reached, the increase of emf stops 
and current decreases to zero. Between L and M the emf 
decreases and current flows out of the capacitor so the 
capacitor discharges and   as the   current   reverses   its 
direction, the sign of the current become negative. This 
reversal of current is shown by the current wave lin FigS
