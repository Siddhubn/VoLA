 Ina oven electric circuit, the broil unit is constructed by 
stringing the element through the frame in two separate 
coils, whereas the bake unit is strung with only one coil. 
Now-a-days instead of thermostat switch,   the typical 
infinite-heat switches are used (Fig). This switch operates 
the internal heater causes the bimetal to open and close 
the switch that controls the range heater element. This 
 Geyser 
 bimetal heater is series the cooking range and must have 
the correct resistance for the element being controlled.

Geyser 
ltisanelectric water heater which heats and maintains the 
temperature of the water stored in it. 
There are several types of water heaters. The most usual 
one is the geyser, which is more efficient as the hot water 
can be directly drawn through a tap at different points. 
Construction of geysers: The construction of a hot water 
geyser   or   storage   water   heater   is   simple 
 (Fig 1). 
 The outer casing is made of mild steel sheet.   The inner 
tank is made of heavy gauge copper which is tinned to 
prevent corrosion.   The space between the outer casing 
and   the   inner   tank   is filled with   glass wool   as   heat 
insulation to avoid excess heatlosses. Heating elements, 
thermostat, inlet and outlet pipes are fitted to the tank. 
Heating   elements   are   similar to   those   of   immersion 
heaters but with different shapes to suit the tank sizes and 
the screw base.   Fig 2 shows a few shapes of heating 
 elements.

 ELN2610022  DIFFERENT SHAPES OF HEATING ELEMENTS 
 The   rating   of the   heating   elements   depends   on the 
capacity of the geyser. For upto 25 litres capacity,   1 KW 
elements are used while for 50 litres capacity 2 KVV are 
used, for 100 litres capacity   3 KW are used. 
Thermostats: Thermostats are used in water heaters to 
control the current to the heating elements and thereby 
regulate and maintain the water temperature between 
 32°C to 88°C. 
 A typical thermostat used in geysers: A thermostat 
used ina geyser is of tube and rod bimetal type (Fig 3). 
Thermostats are available insizes of 8mm diameter with 
a lengthof175mm, 275mmer 480 mmdepending onthe 
height of the geyser. Thermostats are fixed ina tube and 
are connected in series with the heating element. 
The outlet pipe is provided witha’ U'' bend inside the tank 
as shown in Fig 1 to prevent complete draining of water 
from the geyser.   A pilot lamp is fitted on the outer case 
indicating the automatic working of the unit. 
A fusible plug is fitted on the top of the unit to protect the 
inner tank to release the excess pressure that may be 
developed due to failure of the thermostat. 
Working: When a geyser is fitted initially, open the inlet 
cock, fillthe innertank and maintainthe water level. When

 switched “on'' the heater heats the water.   Vhen the 
temperature of water reaches to aset value the thermostat 
disconnects the heater fromthe supply. (Fig 3) The water 
drawn from the outlet pipe reduces the temperature and 
hence the thermostat, re-connects the heater with the 
supply. 
Care   and   maintenance:   A   geyser   requires   less 
maintenance. The scale deposits that may adhere to the 
inside surface should be removed.   It depends on the 
amountand kind of mineral content inthe water. The only 
care required is notto energise the geyser   without initially 
filling with water.

 ¢ state the points to be noted while placing the washing machine at a suitable place. 
Washing machine 
 Itis   adomestic electric appliance which is used to soak, 
rinse, wash, wringle /dry the cloth/fabrics etc. 
Types of washing   machines: The   modern washing 
 machines can be divided roughly into three main groups 
according to their function. 
 They are 
 —   Ordinary 
 —   Semi automatic 
 —   Fully automatic. 
 i   Ordinary type 
 Ordinary without timer: This machine uses the pulsator 
 type technique in which a   disc is fitted to the motor. 
 It has only one tub and one motor the dirty cloth isloaded 
inthe tub, water is filled manually in the tub, detergent is 
 added. The motor is switched onthe pulsator disc moves 
 the cleth around the tub and the time duration of washing 
is decided by the operator. 
 Ordinary with timer: Similar to the ordinary type,   but 
added with a clock timer to select the time of wash from 
1 to 15 minutes. 
 ii   Semi-automatic type 
 This type has two tubs. One for   washing and rinsing, the 
 other forspinadrying the cloths.   The washing tuboperates 
 at lower speed whereas the spin drier tub operates at a 
 higherspeed. The machine may contain either one ortwo 
 motors. 
 iii   Fully automatic type 
 In this type, the micro processor enables to programme 
 the wash cycle. There willbe only onetub. The machine 
 could be programmed for wash cycle, detergent intake 
 and water input. The machine does washing, rinsing and 
also dry ine cloth and siops. 
 Further to the above types the washing machine could be 
 further divided by the type of loading i.e. top loading and 
front loading.   In some machines the water used for 
 washing could be preheated with the help of an electric 
heater, 
Types of wash techniques 
 Inadditionte the above classification, the washing machine 
could be catagorised according to the wash technique 
used as explained below. 
 The pulsator wash technique ( Fig 1): This is the most 
common type   pulsator wash technique,   it has disc in 
concave shape used to rotate the clothes in water. Dirtis 
removed fromthe cloth by rubbing againsttubwall surfaces 
and the disc. (Fig 1 & 2)

 ELN2610082 
 Tumbler type (Fig 3 a): In the tumbler type the washing 
 is carried out by tumbling the cloths with the help of a 
 simple drum.   Here the construction is simple and cloths 
are tumbled around the drum by virtue of the drum itself 
being rotated by means ofa pulley atthe rear orthe friction 
 drive of the idlers. 
 Theagitator wash technique (Fig 36): An agitator which 
is lang and cylindrical is installed at the centre of the 
washing tub.   The water and cloths circulate around the 
agitator, thereby under going a thorough cleaning process. 
Not suitable for delicate fabric. 
The air power wash technique: This machine uses air 
 bubble technique to wash delicate fabrics smoothly. 
The chaos   punch wash technique: A multifaceted 
 method of washing, where in water is propelled upwards in

 rinsing the clothes the machine is switched ‘ON’ fora time 
duration suchthat all the detergent or soap is removed off 
the clothes.   This cycle is called the rinse cycle.   The 
clothes are then put through the mangle wringer to press 
and roll out all the water from the clothes. 
Some type washing machines having heater, is generally 
immersion rod type which is permanently fixed   in the 
bottom   of the   washing   machine.   The   purpose   is to 
produce warm water   for loosening stubborn dirt particles 
of the clothes for quick cleaning. Inthese types generally 
heater is not repairable, once found defective it has to be 
replaced. Fig5 shows the connection diagram of simple 
washing machine with heater . 
The water fall technique: This is more or less similar to 
chaos punch technique.   This machine use jets of water 
which are pumped from below the pulsator in to the tub. 
The velocity anc force of water removes the dirt. Most ofthe 
washing machines could be repaired by the electrician but 
micro processor controlled washing machine repair needs 
some mere training and experience. 
The   conventional   type   with   mangle   wringer   for 
drying: The conventional washing machinesare relatively 
simple inoperation and construction. The washing cycle 
insuch a type of machine would consist of the user filling 
the central tub with water upto the water level mark. Soap 
and bleach are added. 
Depending upenthe types ofthe clothesto be washed the 
‘ON’ time or the wash time of the machine is set andthen 
 ‘the machine is switched ‘ON’.   Most machines have the 
 agitator directly driven without any intermediate gears 
 (Fig 4).

 Precaution 
 i   The agitator should be stopped during the 
drain period, because if it were to continue 
operating   without   water   in   the   tub,   the 
required force on the agitator to rotate the 
clothes in the absence of water would be 
many times more causing motor to overload. 
ii   Thebottom cable should be protected from 
the damage bythe rats by using arust proof 
welded   mesh. 
Thedrive motor: The most popular type of motor usedin 
a   washing machine is a single phase 240 volts 50 Hz. 
capacitor start squirrel   cage   induction   motor.   These 
motors may range from 1/3to 1/2 HP rating. These motors 
are normally protected from overload and overheating 
conditions by means of a bimetallic overload relay or a 
thermal switch.   The motor is located in such a way that 
water leakages do not fall on to these motors. 
Locating the   machine: The machine   should   be so 
located that soft water is freely available, and outlet or 
water drain arrangement is also easily available.   The 
supply   board   should   have   the   rated   3   pin   socket 
arrangement with proper earth brought tothe   3 pinplug 
point. The flooring should be in level such thatthe machine

Pump set 
Pump setis a combination of an electric motor and a 
impellerfoump coupled together to pump the water from 
wellfor) bore for) sump etc., 
Selection   of pump: The following   points are to   be 
considered before selecting a purnp for lifting the water. 
—   The quantity of water to belifted 
—   Helghtofwaterto be delivered 
—   Thetime for lifting. 
Based onthe above considerations the pump has to be 
selected along with the motorta liftthe water from a well! 
Su rip. 
Anillustrationis givenbelowto show how to calculatethe 
required   HP ofthe motorto aparticular height and quantity 
of waterto be lifted within a specified time. 
Example: Calculation of HP fordomestic pump get, 
Apumpdrivenbya-single phase AC motor of 240 50 Hz 
hasto deliver   1000 litre to a height of 30 metre within 15 
minutes.   Find the HP of the motor ifthe efficiency of the 
motor is 60%. 
Given 
Working voltage - 240" 50 Hz 
Quanity of water to be delivered - 1000 litre 
Heightofthe water delivered- 30 mi 
Efficiency of rmotor- 60% 
Tirne of delivery- 15 minute 
Solution

 Pumps   ©   Pumps   can   be   classified   mainly   into   two 
categories.   Theyare 
—   Reciprocating pumps 
—   Rotary purnips. 
Reciprocating pumps : In this type of pump, the main 
moving parthas reciprocating motion onlyand hence the 
name. Fig] showsthe mainpattsata reciprocating pump. 
When the piston movestowardslett, a partial vacuum   is 
created inside the cylinder. The check valve 1 in Fig 1 
closes due to the suction   effect of the vacuum, spring 
actionand head of waterin the discharge tube4 butvalye 
2 Fig 1   opens and   allows the water to fill the cylinder 
through the suction pipe 3 due to atmospheric pressure 
outside. This stroke ofthe piston is called suction strake. 
 Fig 4 
 Onthe otherhand when the piston movestowards right le 
discharge ar delivery stroke the liquid inside the cylinder 
is pushed outthrough checkyalve 1 and delivery pipe 4. 
During the delivery stroke valve 2 remains closed by the 
action ofspring andthe water pressure insidethe cylinder. 
However, as the discharge ofwatertakes place inthistype 
of purnp only   during the discharge   stroke, the   pump 
createsa pulsating flow ofwaterand nota continuausflow. 
This type of purnp is called a piston purnp. 
Rotary pumps © There are very many varieties of this 
pump   in the   market.   However centrifugal pumps, jet 
pumps and submersible purnps are the commonly used 
pumps for lifting water in houses. 
Centrifugal pumps : Fig 2 shows the construction and 
operation of a centrifugal pump, 
The operation of a centrifugal purnipisbased on centrifugal 
force.   Asthe fluid being pumped entersthe inletor central

FLUID FLOW IN A CENTRIFUGAL PUMP  ELN2610042 
 Because the fluid moves faster at the outer edge of the 
impeller the momentum increases. As more fluid enters 
the pump, more fluid momentum is built up in the casing 
that encloses the impeller. This momentum forces the 
fluid out of the pump discharge port. 
The centrifugal pumps are used where large volumes of 
water are to be pumped at relatively low pressure. 
Submersible pumps: This pump also comes under   the 
category of centrifugal pumps and is found inuse at places 
where water is found in great depth. 
Submersible pumps have moter and pump in an axial 
length are submerged in water (Fig 3). Generally such 
pumps are used for borewells where   the volume of water to 
be lifted exceeds the capacity of reciprocating pumps. The 
motor used in such types of pumps is of 3-phase.

 The cables and moterwincings have water proof sealing as 
they are immersed in water. Such pump sets will have 
following advantages. 
 —   Diameter is smaller. 
 —   Motorand pumpare submergedinwater. Hence needs 
no space on ground level. 
—   The motor and pump are entirely connected through 
metal pipes for delivering water. 
—   Efficiency is more as the motor with the pump will be 
to the level of water or inside the water. 
—   Cooling is effectively done by water only. 
—   Canbeusedforliftingwaterfromany depthofsumpor 
borewell as suction pipe is not used. 
Disadvantages 
 —   Erection costand initial cost of purchasing will be high. 
—   Incase ofany defects, itis necessary to remove entire 
 unit along with the pipe line. 
—   Requires   skilled   worker   for   both   erection   and 
maintenance work, 
 Jet pumps : Another variety of centrifugal pumpcommonly 
used inthe domestic wells an d borewells is the jet pump. 
 Injet pumps, the motor and pump are assembledtogether 
in one block (Fig 4).

 The bottem portion ofthe pump hastwo connecting pipes. 
 One is called suction pipe and the other is called ejection 
 pipe. A portion of the water is sent through the ejection 
 pipeto the jetassembly and it aids the water inthe suction 
 pipe to be lifted upwards by Venturi principle. 
Suction, ejection and delivery pipes and motor capacity 
could   be   selected with the   help   of the   performance 
 Table 1. 
Almost all types of pumps may be independent units to be 
 coupled with an electric motor through   belts or couplings 
ormay be single{mono} blocks comprising both motor and 
 pumps. 
 Location of pump set: The pump should be installed as 
near as possible tothe water source inorder to reduce the 
suction lift and to achieve better performance. 
Ample space snould be provided aroundthe pump for easy 
inspection and maintenance whenever required. 
Before starting the pump ensure that. 
—   Shaft rotates freely by hand. 
—   The gland box is properly tightened. 
—   The valve, if there is any on the delivery branch,   is 
opened. 
Check the following during running condition.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
 ¢   state the difference between non-automatic and automatic irons 
 ¢   describe the construction of a bimetal thermostat 
*   illustrate the working of an adjustable thermostat 
*   list the possible faults, their causes and corrective action to be taken in an automatic iron. 
 Automatic electric iron 
 The difference between an automatic iron and the ordinary 
(non-automatic)   iron   is that the automatic type has a 
thermostatic device to regulate the temperature. The other 
parts are more or less the same in both the types of irons. 
 (Fig 1) 
 Automatic irons are fitted with a thermostatic switch to 
regulate the heat to a specific predetermined value. The 
thermostatic switch disconnects the supply when the 
predetermined value is reachedandreconnects the supply 
when the iron cools down.   Aturning knob with a   dial just 
below the handle, markedas rayon, cotton, silk, wool etc. 
can be operated to select the   preset temperature.

 Athermostat is a switch which can be designed to close 
oropenacircuit at predeterminedtemperature. One of the 
simplest and most dependable components in the modern 
heating appliances is the   BIMETAL THERMOSTAT.   It 
controls the   temperature in stoves, toasters, foodwarmers, 
irons etc. Itserves as a safety deviceto prevent overheating 
of the appliances.

 Inthe thermostat there isa bimetal strip made of two strips 
of metal with different expansion rates welded together. 
The metal strip expands when heated and contracts when 
cooled. Gne metal in the bimetal strip has a high rate of 
expansion when heated, and the other has a   low rate. 
When a bimetal strip is heated, both the metals inthe strip 
expand but the one at the bottom with a higher rate of 
expansion expands faster and forces the upper halfto curl 
uporbend away fromthe contact point (Fig 2b). The strip 
curls or bends enough to break the contact, opening the 
circuit. 
Asthe stripcools, itstraightens and restores contact with 
the stationary point. Tne bending of the bimetal strip on 
heating, istowardsthe side that has the smallerexpansion 
rate. 
Adjustable thermostat (Fig 3) 
The operation of the thermostat is as follows. The strip B 
(Fig 3 (a) part B) along withthe silver contact is designed 
suchthat it has upwardtension whereas the control shaft 
moves the strip B either upward or downward depending 
uponthe temperature setting. 
The strip A (Fig 3(a) part A) along with its silver contactis 
designed such that it   has downward tension.   But   its 
downward movement is restricted by the insulated block. 
In the ‘OFF’ position of the temperature setting control 
knob, the strips A and B will be away from each other, 
keeping the silver contacts inanopened condition, thereby, 
keeping the heating element circuit open.

 When the temperature   setting control   knob is set to 
minimum position, the control shaft moves up and allows 
the strip   Band its silver contact to move upwards to some 
distance and make contact with the silver contact of the 
strip A. 
Thus the heating element circuit is closed, the iron heats 
up. The bimetal strip which is also heated, bends upwards 
and the   insulated   block pushes the   strip A,   thereby, 
separating the silver contacts and the heating element 
circuit opens. 
When the iron cools down, the bimetallic strip also cools 
and comes back to   the straight position. The downward 
movement   of   the insulated blockallows silver contact strip 
A to come   in contact with the   silver contact strip B: 
thereby the circuit is closed and the iron heats up. 
Alampfitted near/into the handle of the iron goes offwhen 
the desired temperature is attained. 
Steam/spray irons (IS 6290) 
Electrically there is no difference between steam irons 
anddry irons. Asteamironhas asmall reservoir   mounted 
above the heating element. Acontrol valve onthis allows 
the water to drip slowly into recesses in the sole-plate. 
Acheckvalve keeps the water from going back upintothe 
tank. When the water hits the hot position of the sole- 
plate, itis convertedto steam and goes out through holes 
inthe bottom of the sole-plate. Fig 4 shows a diagram of 
the construction of a typical steam tron. 
Method of repair 
Inmost of the steam irons, the heating element is sealed 
alongwith the sole-plate. Vvhenthe element is found to be 
open or shorted, the sole-plate along with the sealed 
heating element has tobe replaced. Apart from defective 
power cord set and thermostat as found inthe irons, the

 Electric kettle 
 Electrical kettle is a heating device which is used to heat 
the liquid (like water, milk, etc) poured in it. 
There are two types of electric kettles: 
—   Saucepantype 
—   Immersionheatingtype. 
Saucepan type: The construction of the sauce pantype 
kettle is given in Fig 1. The parts are as follows.

 CONSTRUCTION OF SAUCEPAN TYPE KETTLE  ELN261 0071 
 Heating element: Inits general construction, the heating 
elementis made of Nichrome ribbon. The Nichrome ribbon 
is wound over mica. This is placed between two circular 
mica pieces, so that the Nichrome wire may not come in 
contact with any metallic part of the kettle. The two ends 
of the   elements   are   connected   to   the   outlet   socket 
terminals of the kettle through two brass strips. 
Asbestos sheet: This is placed below the element and 
micainsulation to serve as a heatinsulator. Itreducesthe 
heat   loss   in   the   kettle   in   addition   it   gives   increased 
insulation. 
Sole-plate: The sole   plate   is a cast iron   plate neatly 
ground to have a flat surface and its main function is to 
keep the element in close contact with the container and 
to avoid deformation of the element when heated. 
Pressure plate: This is made of cast iron and fitted by a 
nut onthe middle bolt. The pressure plate holds the sole 
plate in position. 
Methodof   fitting new element: Dismantle the kettle by 
the following steps. 
—   Invert the kettle and loosen the bottom cover holding 
nut. Take out the nut and remove the bottom caver. 
—   Removethe brass strip connections of the elements at 
the socket terminal sides. 
—   Remove the terminal socket by loosening the fitting 
 screws. 
 —   Openthe nut of the pressure plate. 
—   Take   out the   pressure   plate,   sole-plate,   asbestos 
sheet and then the heating element. 
—   Replace witha new heating element havingthe correct 
size and rating. 
 —   Reassemble the kettle. 
 —   Test the insulation resistance for any earth fault and 
insulation failure. 
Immersion type: The heating element in this type is of 
tubular immersion heating design.   In some kettles an 
ejector type safety device is incorporated in the socket 
terminal side. 
Incase the kettle is switched ON without water the safety 
pin (Fig 2) which is soldered against a spring which is 
under tension comes out and pushes the plug out. This 
safety pin can be placed in position by soldering. The 
heating element is concealed inside a hollow tube and 
mineral insulated (Fig 3).

 Induction   Heater 
 Objectives: At the end ofthis lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain induction heater 
*   explain construction, advantages and disadvantages of induction heater. 
Aninduction heater uses an electromagnetic field to heat 
food. When the heater is turned on, an electric current 
passes througha   coil of metal, creating a magnetic field. 
This magnetic   field then penetrates the metal of acooking 
pan,   inducing a   current in the   pan.   The   current then 
dissipates energy in the form of heat, cooking the food   in 
the pan. (Fig 1) 
 Fig 4 
 What is induction? 
 Electromagnetic   induction,   which   is often   referred   to 
simply as induction, signifies the productionof anelectric 
currentacross anelectric conductor, causedby achanging 
magnetic field.   Electricity and magnetism are   not two 
disjointedthings: they are two entities originating fromthe 
same underlying phenomenon - electromagnetism. 
Due to this,   a change in a magnetic field leads to the 
generation of electric current. Similarly,   a change inthe 
electric field across a conductor produces a magnetic 
 field. The latter is the working principle behind induction 
 heater, which is pretty much all you need to know to 
understand the working of induction cooktops. 
Induction heater 
Inside view of an induction heater (Fig 2) 
Aninduction heater looks like any other ceramic cooktop, 
with different zones for placing pans and pots of varying 
sizes. Itconsists of atough, heat-resistant glass-ceramic 
plate onwhich the user   places pots and pans that need to 
be   heated.   Directly   underneath the   plate there   is an 
electromagnetic   coil   of   metal   that   is   electronically 
controlled. This is the main component responsible for 
heating the vessels kept above the heater. 
When you switch on the power supply of the heater, an 
electric current   passes through the   coil.   The electric 
current passing through the coil produces a magneticfield 
inall directions around the coil, including directly above it 
(where pots and pans are placed). (Fig 3) Note that until 
this point,   no heat is generated, as the magnetic field 
being produced doesn''t produce any heat unless a third 
object - the cooking pan - is introduced into the mix.

Fig 3 
 Electromagnet 
Electronic Supply 
 VWhena   heater pan (made of a suitable material) is placed 
onthe cooktop, the magnetic field produced by the coil 
penetrates the   metal   of the   pan too.   This fluctuating 
magnetic field now causes an electric current to flow 
through the material of the pan too. The current''induced! 
on the surface of the pan in this way is called an eddy 
current, which is different from the electric currentflowing 
through wires. Eddy currents are actually loops ofelectric 
current that   are   induced   in   a   metallic field   due to   a 
changing magnetic field nearby. 
This induced current travels aroundthe metallic structure 
of the pan, dissipating some of its energy in the form of 
heat. This isthe heat that raises the temperature of the pan

1   Induction heaters are very energy-efficient, inthat they 
transfer most of the energy to the cooking pan with 
minimal loss of energy. (Fig 4) 
2   Also,   induction cooktops heat stuff up very quickly, 
unlike regularstoves, which lose a great deal of energy 
to their Surroundings. 
3   They are also pretty easy to clean and operate and 
safe to use. 
 Fig 4 
 Disadvantages 
A major drawback of induction heater is that they only 
work with pans and pots that are ‘compatible’ with them. 
The containers and vessels placed onthe cooktop should 
containironinsomeform(e.g., stainless steel), asit''sthe 
only metal that efficiently produces eddy currents and 
generates heat through magneticfields. Therefore, glass, 
aluminium and   copper cookware   cannot   be   used   on 
 induction heater. 
 Ina nutshell, using aninduction heater isa smartthingto 
do if you care about electrical efficiency, speedy heating, 
better cooking control and higher levels of safety. As for 
the suitability of your existing   cookware for induction 
cooktops, just try sticking   a magnet to them. If it sticks, 
then the pan/pot is fit to be used.

 Features of the food mixer 
 The   motor   housing   differs   widely   depending   on   the 
manufacturer. Special care to be taken for vibration-free 
running.   Safety features such as overloadtrip, jar mounting 
lock (fixing) and proper lid closing are included in the 
appliances. 
An AC universal motor is housed in the base. The jar 
contains the   cutting   knives which   is the   heart of the 
blending action. Fig   2 shows a schematic diagram of a 
typical mixer. 
Afood mixer power rating ranges from 100 to 750 watts. 
The revolution of the food mixer is 3000 to 14000 revolutions 
per min. The desired speed is selected on the control 
switch.

 The time rating of running the mixer varies from 1 minute 
to60 minutes depending upon the type. A tapped field coil 
enables speed selection through a   rotary or push button 
switch. The food mixer normally runs at 3 speeds. 
Maintenance and   servicing of a food   mixer:   The 
manufacturer''s service   manual,   if available,   read   it a 
number of times and follow the instruction. First listen to 
the complaint from the customer and make a note of it. 
Visually check the mixer right from the plug to the speed 
selector switch connections and enter the details in the 
maintenance card. 
Test the mixer with and without the power cord for the 
continuity   and   insulation   resistance.   The   insulation 
resistance value forthe individual part should not be less 
than 1 Megohm. the power cord should be 3-core andthe 
plug and socket should   be of 3-pin/socket type   with 
 effective earth. 
 But double insulated (PVC body) mixers may have two 
core cable and 2-pin plug type. Adamaged plug or power 
cord should be replaced. Check the brush tension and 
make it normal.   Check the brush length; if found short by 
2/3rd   of its   original   length,   replace   it   with   the   same 
specification   brush   or   a   brush   obtained   from   the 
manufacturer of the mixer. 
Check the switch for its proper function. Betterto replace 
a faulty one witha new one havingthe same specification. 
Before openingthe motor assembly, checkthe couplings 
fortheir properform. Checkthe ply of the shaftand vertical 
movement to get an idea of the condition of the bearings. 
Tight bearing may be due to misalignment, bend in the 
shaft, dried grease or lubricant, dirt, damagedcommutator 
or due to damaged bearing. 
Check the winding for burnt smell or discoloured look. 
Ascertainthrough the tests whether the winding is shorted,

 Wet grinder 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the wet grinder 
*   state the different types of wet grinders 
*   explain the parts of a wet grinder 
¢   explain the possible faults in wet grinders and their remedies. 
Wet grinder 
Itisa domestic electrical appliance, whichis used to grind 
the wet grains. 
Types: There are three types of wet grinders 
—   Gonventional (regular) wet grinder. 
—   Tabletop wet grinder. 
—   Tilting wet grinder. 
Conventional (regular) wet grinder (Fig 1} 
The most common wet grinder used in   houses is the 
container rotating type wet grinder.

 Parts 
 The important parts of a wet grinder are : 
—   Motor 
—   grinding stone 
 —   container 
 —   pulley 
 —   belt 
 —   frameandstand 
 Motor: The motor used in the wet grinders is usually the 
capacitor start-induction motor (Fig 2 & 3).   It has two 
windings.   Both the starting and   running windings are 
energised to start the motor, when the 70 to 80 % of the 
rated speed isreachea, the starting winding is switched off 
by the centrifugal switching system.   The motor then 
operates only on running winding.

One male and one female. The male part grinds the grains 
during rotation against conical cavity in the base (female 
stone).   This female   part   is   actually attached to   the 
stainless steel container which rotates when the motor is 
energised. Both the stones are manufactured with hard 
granite which is usually whitish black in colour. 
Pulley: The drum speed is lower than the motor speed, 
normally 500 to 600 r.p.m.   The motor speed is normally 
1450 1r.p.m. andthe speed of the drumis reduced by using 
a larger diameter pulley than the driven pulley, usually in 
the ratio of 1:3. The transmission of force between the 
driver pulley andthe driven pulley isthrougha V belt of type 
 No A36 or A 39 (Fig 4). 
 Frame and stand: The grindingstones, motor pulleys are 
all housed inarectangular frame with sunmica or stainless 
steel covering orplastic   mouldingfor decoration as wellas 
safety.   A separate vertical stand is provided on one side 
ofthe grinder for holding the male grinding stone. If the MS 
frame is used, it is usually to be chromium plated. 
Wet   grinder-   maintenance   and   servicing:   In   wet 
grinders, the trouble may be classified into two types. 
Electrical faults and Mechanicalfaults. Same mechanical 
faults create electrical faults too. 
Some common problems andtheir rectifications are given 
in the Table 1.

 Transformer 
 Transformer is a static electric device which transfer the 
electric energy from one circuit to other without changing 
the frequency and power. 
The three-phase synchronous generator is used extensively 
to generate bulk power. The voltage levels at which this 
power is generated is typically inthe range11kVto22kV. 
Electrical   power   is to   be   provided   at   a   considerable 
distance   from   a   generating   station.   It   is   possible   to 
transmit the generated power directly but this results in 
unacceptable power losses and voltage drops. 
Transmission voltages vary upto the 400 kV level. Thisis 
made possible by power transformers. At the receiving 
end this high voltage must be reduced because ultimately 
it must supply three phase load at 415¥V or single phase 
load at 240V. 
The transformer makes it possible for various parts of a 
power system to operate at different voltage levels. 
Standard   safety   norms:   Trainees   can   be 
instructed to refer the standard safety norms 
related with transformer in the International 
Electrotechnical commission (IEC -60076-1)for 
the further details. 
Construction: There are basically twotypes of iron-core 
construction.   Figia showsa core type transformer. It 
consists of two separate coils, one on each of the two 
opposite legs of a rectangular core.

 Normally, this is not a desirable design. Its disadvantage 
is the large leakage fluxes associated with it. The large 
leakage fluxes cause poor voltage regulation. Therefore, to 
 260 
 ensure that most ofthe flux set by the primary will link the 
secondary, the construction   Fig 1b is employed. This is 
called shell type construction. 
Here the two windings are wound concentrically. The 
higher voltage winding is wound ontop ofthe lower voltage 
winding. The low-voltage winding is then located closerto 
the steel. This arrangementis preferable froman electrical 
 insulating point of view. Fromthe electrical viewpointthere 
 is not much difference between the two constructions. 
Cores may be built up of lamination silicon steel sheet. 
Most laminating   materials have an approximate alloy 
content of 3% silicon and 97% iron. The silicon content 
reduces the   magnetizing   losses.   Particularly, the loss 
due to   hysteresis   is   reduced   The   silicon   makes the 
material   brittle.   The   brittleness   causes   problems   in 
stamping operation. 
Mostlaminated materials are cold-rolled and often specially 
annealed to orient the grain or iron crystals. This provides 
very high permeability and low hysteresis to the flux inthe 
direction of rolling. Transformer laminations are usually 
0.25t00.27 mmthick for 50 Hz. operation. The laminations 
are coated on one side by a thin layer of varnish or paper 
to insulate them from each other. 
Coils are pre-wound, and the core design must be such 
that it permits placing the coil onthe core. Ofcourse, the 
core must then be made   in atleast two sections. The 
laminations forthe core-type transformer of Fig   1amay be 
made upof (L and   1) shapedlaminations, as shownin 
Fig 2a. The core for the shell type transformer is normally 
made up of   E and I shaped laminations   (Fig 2b).

 Ideal Transformer on Load: When the secondary is 
 connectedto aload, secondary current flows this in turn 
 rmakesthe primary currentto increase. Howthis happens 
isexplained below. 
The relationship between primary and secondary currents 
ishaseduponacomparison ofthe primary and secondary 
 amperetums. 
 Whenthe secondaryis open circuit, the primary current 
issuchthatthe primary arnpere turns are just sufficientto 
produce the flux ''s’ necessary to induce an EMF (E,) that 
ispractically equal and opposite tothe appliedvaltage v,’. 
Themagnetising current isusuallyabout2 to S percent of 
the fullload primary current 
When aloadisconnected acrossthesecondaryterminals, 
the   secondary   current   -   by   Lenz''s   law -   produces 
demaqnetising effect.   Consequently the flux and the 
EMFinduced in the primary are reduced slightly. 
Butthis smallchange mayincrea se the difference betwe ean 
applied valtage “and the induced EMF (E,j by say 1 
percent inwhich case the newprimary current would be 20 
timesthe no load current. 
The demagnetising ampere turns of the secondary are 
thus nearly neutralized by the increase in the primary 
ampere turns and since the primary ampere tumsoanno 
load are very small compared with the full load ampere 
 turns.

 Fromthe above statement, itis clear that the magnetic flux 
forms   the   connecting   link   between   the   primary   and 
secondary   circuits and that any variation of the secondary 
current is accompanied by a small variation ofthe flux and 
therefore   of the   EMFinduced   in the   primary,   thereby 
enabling   the   primary   current   to   vary   approximately, 
proportional to the secondary current. 
EMF equation of atransformer: Since the magneticflux 
set up by the primary winding links the secondary winding, 
an   EMF   will   be an   induced   E.,   in   the secondary,   in 
 accordance with Faraday’s law, namely,   E=N(6@/ét). The 
 same flux also links the primary itself, inducinginitan emf, 
 E,. The induced voltage must lag the flux by 90°, therefore, 
 they are 180° out of phase with the applied voltage V 
Since there is no currentinthe secondary winding, E,= V.,. 
The primary voltage and the resulting flux are sinusoidal; 
thus the   induced quantities   E,   and E, vary as a sine 
function. The average value ofthe induced voltage is given 
 by 
 change in flux ina given time

Objective: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
 * explain rating of transformer 
 *   calculate the voltage, current and turns   of primary from the secondary data and vice versa. 
Rating of transformer 
The capacity of the transformers are always rated by its 
apparent power (volt amp - VA (or KVA), not by its true 
power ( watt (or) KW) (ie.) KW = KVA x Coso . 
Example 1: A 100 KVA 2400/240V, 50 Hz. transformer 
has 300 turnsonthe secondary winding. Calculate (a) the 
approximate value of primary and secondary currents (b) 
the number of primary turns and (c) the maximum flux o, 
in the core.

 Objectives : At the end of this exercise you shall be able to 
 ¢   state the classification of transformers based on various factors. 
Classification of Transformers 
 1   Classification based on the type of Core Material 
 used 
 *   Air coretransformers | Fig 1, air core transformers 
consists of a hollow nonmagnetic core, made of paper 
or   plastic   over which   the   primary   and   secondary 
windings are wound. These transformers will have 
values of k less than   1.   Air core transformers are 
generally used in highfrequency applications because 
these will have no iron-loss as there is no magnetic 
core material.

 2   Classification based on the shape of core 
*   Coretypetransformers:   |InCore type of transformer, 
the primary andsecondary windings are ontwo separate 
sections/limb of core. (Fig 1 in chart 1) 
*   Shelltypetransformers: Inthis type, boththe primary 
and the secondary windings are wound on the same 
section/limb of the   core These   are widely used as 
voltage and power   transformers.   (Fig 2 in chart 1) 
*   Ring type transformers: Inthis, the core is made up 
of circular or semicircular laminations (Fig 3). These 
are stacked and clamped together to forma   ring. The 
primary and secondary windings are then wound onthe 
ring.   The disadvantage of this type of construction is 
the   difficulty   involved   in   winding   the   primary   and 
secondary coils.   Ringtype transformers are generally 
used as instrument transformers for measurement of 
high voltage and current. 
3   Classification based on the Transformation ratio 
¢   Step-up Transformers: Transformers in which, the 
induced secondary voltage is higher than the source 
voltage givenatprimary are calledstep-uptransformers. 
*   Step-down Transformers: Transformers in which, 
theinduced secondary voltage is lower thanthe source 
voltage   given   at   primary   are   called   step-down 
transformers. 
*   Isolation transformers: Transformers in which, the 
induced secondary voltage   is same as that of the 
source voltage given at primary are called one-to-one or 
isolationtransformers. Inthese transformers the number 
of turns inthe secondary will be equal to the number of 
turns in the primary making the turns ratio equal to 1. 
4   Single phase and three phase transformers 
Transformers Fig 4 of Chart 1 are designed for use with 
single phase AC mains supply. Such transformers are 
known as single phase transformers. Transformers are 
also available for 3 phase AC mains supply. These are 
knownas poly-phase transformers. Refer FigSin Chart. 
Three phase transformers   are used in electrical distribution 
and for industrial applications. 
§   Classification based on application 
Transformers can also be classified depending upontheir 
applicationfora specialized work. There are innumerable 
number of applications, However a few of these are listed 
below: 
Instrument Transformers - used in clip   - on current 
meters, overload   trip circuits etc., 
Constant voltage transformers - Usedto obtain stabilized 
voltage supply forsensitive equipments 
Ignition transformers - Used in automobiles 
Welding transformers - used in welding equipments 
Dry Type   Transfomers   :   Dry type,   or   air-cooled, 
transformers are commonly used for indoor applications 
where other transformer types are considered too risky.

Itis a fabricated M.S plate tank used for housingthe core, 
winding and for mounting various accessories required for 
the operationof atransformer. Core is builtfromcoldrolled 
grain oriented silicon steel lamination. The L. V winding is

 2   Conservatortank 
 Itis in the shape of a drum, mounted on the top of the 
transformer. Anoil level indicator isfittedto the conservator 
tank.   Conservator is connected to the transformer tank 
througha pipe. The conservator carries the transformer ail 
toaspecifiedlevel. Whentransformeris heated up due to 
normal load operation, the oil expands and the level of oil 
in conservator tank is increased or vice versa.   A pipe 
connected to the top of the conservator tank allows the 
internal air to go out or get in through the breather. 
It reduces the oxidation of oil when it get contact with alr. 
3   Temperature gauge 
Itis fitted to the transformer whichindicates the temperature 
ofthe transformer oil. 
4   Cooling tubes 
In earlier discussions, we found that the transformer is 
heated up, when the transformer is connected to the 
supply is due te ironloss and copper loss. To keep down 
the temperature of the windings, when the transformer is 
put on load, the heat generated inside the transformer 
should be radiated to the atmosphere.   To dissipate the 
heat produced inside the windingand core, the transformer 
tank is filled with an insulating oil. The oil carries the heat 
to the   cooling   pipes where the   heat   is dissipated   to 
atmosphere due to surface contact with air. 
5   Tap changer 
When voltages are transmitted over long distances there 
will be voltage drop in the conductors, resulting in lower 
voltage at the receiving end.   To compensate this line 
voltage drops inthe conductors, itis customary to increase 
the sending end voltage by tap changing transformers. 
These transformers may have several winding taps in their 
primary winding ( Fig 2}. 
6   Porcelain bushing of transformer 
This type of Transformer Bushings are used in several 
power industries for their robustness and they are also 
very cheap. Porcelain offers very good and reliable electrical 
insulation for a wide range of voltages as wellas they have 
high dielectric strength too.

 MANUALLY OPERATED TAP - CHANGING 
 A   porcelain   bushing   is   a   hollow   cylindrical   shaped 
arrangement made by porcelain discs which is fitted tothe 
top portion of the transformer. Andthe energised conductors 
are passed through the centre portion of the bushings. 
After inserting the conductor, the ends of the porcelain 
bushings are   tightly sealed with glaze and this arrangement 
ensures a prevention from any type of moisture. 
The entire bushing arrangement is checked and it should 
not contain any leakage paths.   If the operating voltage 
levelisvery highthenthe vacuum space of the Transformer 
Bushing is filled with insulating oil. 
7   Protective - devices / parts of transformers: 
1   Breather 
Transformer oil deteriorationtakes place due to moisture. 
Moisture can appear ina transformer fromthree sources, 
viz. by leakage through gasket, by absorption from air in 
contact with the oil surface or by its formation within the 
transformer as a product of deterioration as insulation 
ages at high temperature. 
The effect of moisture in oil is to reduce the di-electric 
strength, especially if loose fibres or dust particles are 
present. 
 Methods   available   to   reduce   oil   contamination   from 
 moisture are: 
«   by the use of silica gel breather 
*   by the use of rubber diaphragm 
*   by using sealed conservator tank 
*   by using gas cushion 
*   by using thermosyphon filter 
Silica gel   breather 
Silica gel   breather is a   protective device fitted to the 
conservator through a pipe and allows the moisture free air

silica gel is available in blue colour. The colour of the silica

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the principle of auto-transformer 
¢   describe the construction of auto-transformer 
¢   State the advantages, disadvantages and appliations of auto-transformer. 
 Auto transformer 
 «   The autotransformer   is a transformer having single 
winding which acts as primary as well as secondary 
winding. 
*   The auto transformer works on the principle of self 
inductance of Faraday''s Law of electro - magnetic 
induction. 
The induced voltage per turn was the same in each and 
every turn linking with the common flux in the core. 
Therefore, fundamentally it makes no difference in the 
operation   whether the   secondary   induced   voltage   is 
obtained from a separate winding linked with the core, or 
from a portion of the primary turns. The same voltage 
transformation results in both the situations. 
 Construction 
 Anordinary two winding transformer may also be used as 
an auto-transformer by connecting the two windings in 
series and applying the voltage across the two, or merely 
to one of the windings. 
It depends on whether it is desired to keep the voltage 
clown or up, respectively. 
Figs 1 and 2 show these connections. 
Considering Fig 1, the inputvoltage Vis connectedto the 
complete winding a -c andthe load R, is across a portion 
ofthe winding, thatis, b-c. The voltage V, is relatedto V 
as ina conventional two winding transformer, namely, 
 ac 
 Where   N,.   and   N   are   the   number of turns   on   the 
respective windings. The ratio of voltage transformationin 
an autotransformer is the same as that for an ordinary 
transformer. 
with a < 1 for step down. 
Advantages : Auto-transformers: 
 *   less cost 
 *   havebetter voltage regulation 
 *   aresmaller

 *   are lighterinweight 
*   are more efficient when compared with two winding 
transformers of the same capacity. 
Disadvantages:   Auto-transformers   have   two 
disadvantages. 
*   An auto-transformer does not isolate the secondary 
from the primary circuit. 
«   lf the   common   winding   be   becomes open   circuit, 
referring to Fig 1 or 2, the primary voltage can stillfeed 
the load. Witha step-down auto-transformer this could 
result in burnt out secondary load and/or a serious 
shock hazard, particularly ifthe step down   ratio is high. 
Application: The common applications are: 
*   fluorescent lamps (where supply voltage is less than 
the ratedvoltage) 
*   reduced voltage motor starter 
*   series line boosters for fixed adjustment of line voltage

 Instrument   transformers   -   current   transformer 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the necessity, types and principle of the instrument transformer 
*   explain the construction and connection of the current transformer 
*   state the precautions to be followed while using the current transformer. 
Necessity of instrument transformers: Transformers 
used   in   conjunction   with   measuring   instruments   for 
measurement   purposes   are   called   ‘instrument 
transformers’. the actual measurements are done by the 
measuring instruments only. 
Where   the   current   and voltage   are very   high,   direct 
measurements are not possible as, these current and 
voltage are too large for reasonably sized instruments and 
the cost of the meter will be high. 
The solution is to step-down the current and voltage with 
instrument transformers, so that, they could be metered 
with instruments of moderate size. 
These instrument transformers electrically isolate the 
instruments and relays from high current/voltage lines 
thereby reducing danger to the men and equipment. To 
obtain perfect isolation, the secondary of the instrument 
transformers and the core should be grounded. 
Type of instrument transformers: Three are twotypes 
of instrument transformers. 
*   Currenttransformer 
 *   Potential transformer 
 The transformer used for measurement of high currentis 
called ‘currenttransformer or simply ‘CT’ 
the transformer used for high voltage measurement is 
called ‘voltage transformer or potential transformer’ or 
simply ‘PT’ in short. 
Principle: Instrument transformers work onthe principle 
of mutual induction similar to the two winding transformers. 
In the case of an instrument transformer, the following 
design features are to be considered. 
Core:   In order to minimise the error,   the magnetizing 
current must be kept low. This means the cores should 
have low reactance and low core losses. 
Winding: The winding should be close together   to reduce 
the secondary leakage reactance;   otherwise the ratio 
error willincrease. Inthe case of acurrenttransformer the 
winding must be so designed as to withstand the large 
short circuit current without damage. 
Current transformers -   types of construction and 
connection 
The following are   the differentty pes of currenttransformers. 
Wound type current transformer: This is one in which 
the primary winding is having more than one full turn wound 
on the core ( Fig 1)

ELN2710881  WOUND TYPE CURRENT TRANSFORMER 
 Fig   1   shows the connections of a wound type current 
transformer having a rectangular type of core. In general 
the ammeter is arranged to give full scale deflection with 
SA or   1Awhen connected to the secondary of the current 
transformer. 
The ratio betweenthe primary and secondary turns of the 
current transformer decides the primary current which

 Accuracyclass: Accuracy classis a designation assigned 
toacurrenttransformer the errors of which remain within 
the specified limits under prescribed conditions of use. 
The standard accuracy classes for measuring current 
transformers shall be 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0. 
Precautions while using the current transformer   : |n 
acurrenttransformerthe secondary current depends upon 
the primary current. Futher the secondary of the current 
transformer could be assumed to be almost short circuited 
as the ammeter resistance is extremely low. 
 Fig 3 
 ELN2?10629 BAR TYPE CURRENT TRANSFORMER 
 In   any   case,   the   secondary   winding   of   the   current 
transformershould not be opencircuited. This may happen 
when the ammeter become open circuited or when the 
ammeter is removed fromthe secondary. 
Insuch cases the secondary should be short circuited. If 
the secondary Is not short circuited, in the absence of 
secondary ampere-turns, the primary current will produce 
abnormally high flux in the core thereby heating up the 
core and resulting in burning out the transformer. 
Further secondary will produce a high voltage across its 
open terminals endangering safety. Inadditionto earthing 
non-current carrying metal parts of the currenttransformer, 
we have to earth one end of the secondary of the current 
transformer to preventa high static potential difference in 
case of opencircuit. Italso serves as a safeguard incase 
of insulation failure. 
Specification of acurrenttransformer: VVhile purchasing 
a current transformer, the following specifications need to 
be checked. 
*   Rated voltage, type cf supply and earthing conditions 
(for example, 7.2 kV, three phase, whether earthed 
through a resistor or solidly earthed). 
¢   Insulation level 
*   Frequency 
 *   Transformationratio 
 *   Ratedoutput 
*   Class of accuracy 
e   Short time thermal current and its duration 
Standard values of rated primary current: The standard 
values inamperes of ratedfrequency are 10,   15, 20, 30, 50, 
7S amperes and their decimal multiples. 
Standard   values   of   rated   secondary current:   The

 Objectives: At the end ofthis lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the construction and connection of the potential transformer 
*   state specification of PT. 
 Potential transformer 
 Construction and connection: The construction of a 
potential transformer is essentially the same as that ofa 
power   transformer. The main difference is that the volt- 
ampere rating of a potential transformer is very small. 
To reduce the error ina potential transformer, itis required 
to provide a short magnetic path, good quality of core 
materials,   low flux density and proper assembling and 
interlaying of cores. 
To   reduce   resistance   and   leakage   reactance,   thick 
conductors are Used and the two windings are kept as 
close as possible. 
The core may be of shell or core type construction. Shell 
type   construction   is   normally   used   for   low   voltage 
transformers. 
The primary and secondary windings are coaxialto reduce 
the leakage reactance tothe minimum. In orderto simplify 
the insulation problem, generally a low voltage winding 
(secondary) is put next to the core. 
The primary winding may be of a single coil inthe case of 
low voltage transformers but in the case of high voltage 
transformers the winding is divided into a number of short 
coils. 
Fig 1   shows the connections of a potential transformer. In 
general, the voltmeter connected to the secondary of the 
potential transformeris arranged to give fullscale deflection 
at   110 volts. 
The ratio betweenthe primary and secondary turns of the 
potential transformers decides the primary voltage which 
could be measured with the fixed secondary voltage rating 
 of   110 volts (Fig 1).

 ELN271 0881  CONNETION OF POTENTIAL TRANSFORMER 
 If the primary turns are four, the secondary turns are two 
and the   primary   is connected to a voltage   source   of 
magnitude 220 volts, the secondary voltage will be 110 
volts according to the transformation ratio. 
Precautions to be followed while using a potential 
transformer: The assembly comprising of the chasis 
frame work and the fixed part of the metal casing of the 
voltage transformer shall be provided with two separate, 
readily accessible, corrosion-free terminals marked legibly 
as earth terminals. 
Specification   of   a   potential   transformer:   VVhile 
purchasing   a   potential   transformer,   the   following 
specifications need to be checked. 
*   Rated voltage, type of supply and earthing conditions 
(for example 6.6 KV, 3 phase solid earthed)

likely to exist or arise, such as exposure to steam or 
vapour,   furnes,   explosive   gases,   excessive   dust, 
vibrations etc. 
*   Special features, such as limiting dimensions. 
«   Whether   the   voltage   transformer   is   required   for

Transformer losses - OC and SC test - efficiency - Voltage Regulation 
 Objectives: At the end ofthis lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the type of losses occured in transformer 
*   explain Iron (No -   load) losses and copper (load) losses in transformer. 
 Losses 
 There are two type of losses occured in the transformer 
such as iron (core) loss (Hysterisis   + eddy current) and 
copper (Ohmic) or load loss 
Iron (or) No-load losses: The no load losses consist of 
two components i.e hysteresis and eddy current loss. The 
hysteresis loss due to the cyclic variation of the magnetic 
flux in the ferrous metal. 
The eddy current occurs because of the changing flux in 
the core, (according to Lenz''s law) inducing avoltage inthe 
core. As a result, circulating eddy currents set up in the 
core with subsequent I°R loss. This is also calledas iron 
loss (or) coreloss (or) constantlosses. 
As the   core flux   in   a transformer   remains   practically 
constant at all loads, the core-loss is also constant at all 
loads.   This is also known as no-load losses.

 Eddy current loss W, 
 where k,,   =   the hysteresis constant

K,   =   the eddy current constant 
 These losses are minimised by using steel of high silicon 
content (from 1.Oto 4.0 percent) forthe core and by using 
very thin laminations. 
Siliconsteel has a high saturation point, good permeability 
at high flux density, and moderate losses. Silicon steel is 
widely   used   in   power   transformers,   audio   output 
transformers and many other applications. 
The   input   power of a transformer,   when on   no-load, 
measures the core-loss. 
Copper (or) Load losses: This loss is mainly due to the 
ohmic resistance of the transformer windings.   The load 
current   through   the   resistances   of   the   primary   and 
secondary windings creates |°R losses that heat up the 
copper   wires and causes voltage drops. Thislossis also 
called copper losses (or)   variable losses.   Copper 
losses are measured by   the short circuit test. 
Thecorelossinatransformer is aconstantloss 
for allload conditions. The copper loss varies 
proportionally to the square of the current. 
 Open Circuit (O.C) test of a transformer 
 Objective: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
 * explain the method of conducting an open circuit test 
 ¢   calculate the exact iron loss. 
 The open circuit 
The opencircuittest is performedto determine the no-load 
losses or the core losses. 
In this test,   a rated voltage is applied to one winding, 
usually the low-voltage winding for safety reasons, while 
the other is left open-circuited. The input power supplied 
to the transformer represents mainly core losses.   Since 
the no-load current is relatively small the copper loss may 
be neglected during this test. 
The circuitinstruments are shown in Fig 1. The wattmeter 
indicates the core loss.   The voltmeter will register the 
rated voltage.   The ammeter reading in conjunction with 
voltage will provide the necessary data to obtaininformation 
about the magnetizing current. 
The core loss can be measured on either side of the 
transformer.   For instance, if a 3300/240V transformer 
were to be tested the voltage would be applied to the 
secondary side, since 240V is more readily available. 
The core loss measured on either side of the transformer 
would be the same, because 240V is applied to a winding 
that has fewer   turns than the high voltage side. Thus the 
voltfturn ratio is the same.   This implies that the value of 
the maximum flux in the core is the same in either case. 
The core loss depends on the maximum flux. 
The frequency ofthe o.c. test supply should be equal to the 
rated frequency of the transformer. 
The actual (exact) iron loss (W)) can be calculated by the 
formula 
 lronloss

 Objectives: At the end ofthis lesson you shallbe able to 
*   explain the method of conducting the short circuit test on asingle phase transformer 
*   calculate the equivalent resistance and equivalent reactance of the transformer, with respect to high 
voltage circuit 
*   calculate the copper loss. 
 Short circuittest: 
 Ashort circuittestis requiredta determine thetransformer 
equivalent circuit parameters and copper losses.   The 
connected diagram forthe short circuit test is shown in 
Fig 1.

 The low voltage side of the transformer is short circuited, 
Avreduced voltage applied onthe high voltage winding of 
thetransformer such thatthe rated current flows through 
the   ammeter.   In this condition the impedance   of the 
transformeris merelyasequivalentimpedenence (Fig 2).

 The testis performed onthe highvoltage side because it 
is convenient to apply a small percentage of the rated 
 voltage.   Inthe case of a SSUDW/240¥ transformer, tt is 
 easier and more accurate to deal with 5% of SSO00than 
with   % of 240" 
With the primary voltage greatly reduced, the flux will be 
reduced   to the same extent.   Since the core   loss is 
somewhat proportional to the square of the flux, it   is 
practically zera, 
Thus a wattmeter used to measure the input power will 
indicate the copperlosses only: the output power is zero. 
 From the input data obtained from the instruments, the 
equivalent reactance, canbe calculated.   Allthe values 
 calculated are in termsofhigh voltage side.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able ta 
*   calculate efficiency from the losses 
*   state the condition for maximum efficiency 
*   define all-day efficiency of a distribution transformer. 
Efficiency oftrans former: 
In general, the efficiency of any electrical apparatus is 
 _ output power _|   ouiput power   | 
 input power   [output   power + losses] 
where 1) 1s the symbol used ta denote efficiency. Vwhen 
equation {1} is multiplied bythe factor   100 the efficiency 
willbein percent. 
The efficiency of atransformeris high and inthe range 95 
10.96%. Thisimpliesthatthe transformerlosses are as low 
as2 to 5% of the input power. 
While calculatingthe efficiency   itis generally much better 
to determine the transformer losses ratherthan measured 
the input and output powers directly, 
Intransformer theopencircuittest yields the core losses 
and the shart circuittest providesthe copperlosses. Thus 
the efficiency can be determined fromm these data with 
reasonable accuracy. 
Thetransformerratings are based on outputKVA(MVvA). 
Therefore the equation for efficiency may be written as 
 BMA   out   PF 
i 
juKwa   ae   =x PF)   + Copper   boss   +   core   [oss  t 
 Condition for maximum efficiency: 
The efficiency of a transformer is at   amaximum when the 
fixed   losses are   equal to the variable   lasses. In other 
words, when the copperlossesis equaltothe iran losses, 
the efficiency is maximum, 
Example: A transformer with a rating af 10 Kv 2200 
220/50 Hz was tested with the following results. 
Short circuit test power input = 340 VW 
Open circuittest power input= 166 WV

fii) The maximum efficiency accurs at a load when the 
copper loss = core logs. 
Thus the copper loss = core loss = 166 VV 
Let the current at full load =   |. 
The current at maximum efficiency =I’, 
Then, the copper loss at fulllaad =   PR, = 240 Wi

As the load is primarily lighting, the PF = 1.0. 
(a) Output energy at FLin 3 hours

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   define the voltage regulation of a transformer 
*   calculate the voltage regulation of a transformer. 
Voltage regulation: 
The voltage regulation of a transformer is the difference 
between the   no-load and full   load secondary voltage 
expressed as a percentage of   the full load voltage.   The 
 primary or applied voltage must remain constant. 
 This is an additional condition that must be fulfilled in the 
 case of transformers. 
Also, the powerfactor of the load must be stated since the 
voltage regulation does depend onthe load powerfactor. 
Ingeneral, 
Voltage regulation = 
 V noload   -   Vinad

 x 100% 
 Let V, = Secondary terminal voltage at no-load 
V,=   Secondary terminal voltage at load.

 The numerical values employed inthe calculations depend 
onwhich winding is used as areference for the equivalent 
circuit. Similar results are obtained whether all impedance 
values are transferred to the primary or to the secondary 
side of the transformer. 
Example: 
The secondary voltage of 11KV/440V,   100KVA transformer 
is 426 Vat no-load.   Under the fullload condition, the same 
is 410¥V at 0.92 Power factor. Calculate the percentage 
voltage regulation of the transformer.

of various transformers, to be runin parallel, do not   show 
identical values, there will be circulating currents between 
the secondaries (and therefore between primaries also) 
when the secondary terminals are connected in parallel. 
The impedances of transformers is small, so that a small 
percentage voltage difference may be sufficient to circulate 
considerable current and cause additional I7R loss. 
Vvhen secondaries are loaded, the circulating current will 
tendto produce unequal loading conditions. Thus it may 
be impossible to take the full load output from the parallel 
connected groupwithout one of the transformers becoming 
excessively heated. 
Impedance: The currents carried by the two transformers 
are proportional to their ratings: 
*   if their numerical or ohmic impedances are inversely 
 proportional to those ratings, and 
 *   their per unit impedances are identical. 
Adifference inthe quality factor   (i.ethe ratio of reactance 
to   resistance)   of the   per unit   impedance   results in   a 
divergence ofthe phase angle of the currents, sothat one 
transformer willbe working witha higher andthe other with 
a lower power factor than that of the combined output. 
Verification of terminals or Polarity: Whentwo or more 
transformers are to be   connected   in   parallel   on their 
primary and secondary sides, the terminals of the same 
polarity only can   be connected together,   otherwise a 
heavy circulating current will be produced between the 
windings. 
Standard procedure to determine the polarity is explained 
below:- 
*   connectone endof the highvoltage windingto one end 
of the low voltage winding as shown in Fig 2a. 
*«   Connecta voltmeter between the two open ends. 
*   Apply a voltage not greater thanthe rated voltage ofthe 
winding to either high or low voltage winding. 
IfV, reads lessthan V, (Fig 2a) the primary and secondary 
emfs are in opposition. The marking on primary will be A, 
 for +ve side and A, for -ve side and a, for t+ve side of 
 secondary anda, for—ve side. Ifthe connections are made 
(Fig 2b) the voltmeter V, will read   more than V,. Thereby 
itis ascertained opposite ends are connected.

 If in transformer has similar ends in one side (Fig 3a) the 
polarity marking is said to be subtractive polarity marking 
onthe other hand ifthe opposite ends are inone side ( Fig

 Series   (Secondary   only)   operation   of transformers 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the necessity of series operations 
*   state the conditions to be fulfilled for series operation 
Series operation: 
The connection diagram for series operation (secondary 
only} of two identical transformers is given below (Fig 1) 
Necessity for series operations: 
In   general,   the transformers are   available with some 
standard input (primary) and output (secondary) voltages. 
In order to get some intermediate voltage for example , 
36V,   48 V for special purpose, the series operation of 
transformers (secondary only) are necessary. 
In series operation, individual secondary voltages of both 
transformers are added if they are connected with proper 
polarity, but the current ratings are remains same.

Both transformers should be identical i.e, 
a) Voltage ratio/turns ratio must be same 
b} Polarities must be same 
c) Type of core of both transformers (core or shelltype) 
must be same. 
d) Input voltages of both transformers must be same. 
e) KVA ratings of both transformers must be same. 
f)   Percentage impedance or per unit impedance of 
both the transfers must be same. 
 Precautions: 
 *   The polarities of secondary of both 
transformers should be connected in 
proper way, sameas series connection, to 
get the voltage added, otherwise the 
output voltage will be zero. 
*   As the output voltage is double that the 
individual secondary voltages, care to be

 Transformers,   like   other   electrical   devices,   may   be 
connected into series, parallel, two-phase or three-phase 
arrangements. When they are grouped together in any of 
 these arrangements the group is called a transformer   1Uy ae   vy te   Wah

 The high voltage and low voltage winding terminals of a 
three-phase transformer are connectedeitherinstarorin 
delta for connections to a three-phase system. 
When the primary high voltage winding terminals 
are connected in, say, star and the secondary low 
voltage winding   terminals   are   connected   in,   say, 
delta,   it is said that the transformer windings are 
connected in star-delta (U-   D   or U-d).   Similarly

 Angular displacement (divergence): There   is a definite 
time phase relationship between the terminal voltages of 
the   high voltage   side   and   low voltage   side for these 
connections. The time phase relationship between the 
voltages of high voltage side and low voltage sides will 
depend   upon   the   manner   in which   the   windings are 
connected. 
If the high voltage side and low voltage side windings are 
connected in star-star (as in Fig 1a and 1b). Tne phase 
displacement will be zero.   If, however, the low voltage 
winding connections are reversed, as shown in Figs 2(a) 
and (b), the time phase displacement in induced voltages 
between the high voltage and low voltage windings will be 
180 degrees. 
Ifthe primary high voltage and secondary low voltage side 
windings are connected in Yd er Dy as shown in Figs 3(a) 
and (b}, the phase displacement will be - 30 degrees. 
The displacement inthe clockwise direction is 
negative.   Anti clockwise is positive.

 If the windings are connected in Yd or Dy as Figs 4 (a) & 
(b), the displacement of the terminal voltage will be + 30°. 
Observe the change   in connections made at the low

 Scott connection or T.T. connection: Incertainspecial 
equipment   the   line   voltage   required   for   its   3-phase 
connection may not be of standard rating as available in 
the system.   Further, the power consumption in these 
equipment may also be high.   To meet this requirement 
Scott connected transformers are usec.   These Scott 
connected transformers enable transformation of 3-phase 
to 3-phase more economically. 
This Scott connection can also be used for 3-phase to 2- 
phase transformation as explained subsequently. 
The main transformer has centre tapped primary and 
secondary windings Fig 5.   The primary and secondary 
windings are indicated by CB and cb respectively in the 
Fig 5.   Anothertransformer called teaser transformer has 
a 0.866 tap and one end of both the primary and secondary 
windings of the teaser transformer   (say D and d) is joined 
tothe centre tap of both primary andsecondary ofthe main 
transformer. 
The other end Aoftheteasertransformer andthe two ends 
Band C   ofthe main transformer primary are connectedthe 
3-phase supply. 
3-phase supply is taken outfrom one end''a’ of the teaser 
transformer secondary and the two ends b and c of the 
secondary of the main transformer.

 ELN2?7411016: 
 By analysing the vector diagram   Fig 5b, it is found that 
voltage E... and E... are each SOV and differ in phase by 
180° because both the coils DB and DC are in the same 
magnetic circuit and are connected in opposition. Fig Sd 
shows the schematic connection diagram. 
 Eachside ofthe equilateraltriangle represents 100V. The 
 voltage E,,, being the altitude of the equilateral triangle is 
equal   to   3 /2.100=866y   and   legs   behind   the 
voltage across the main by 90°. The sare relation holds 
good forthe secondary voltages. Thetransformerratingis 
restrictedto 86.6% ofits KVArating. By suitable turnratio 
the trnsformer rating can be improved to 92.8%. 
3-phase to 2-phase conversion and vice versa:   In 
industrial   application of electric   power supply   certain 
equipment like electric furnaces and welding transformers 
require two phase supply. 
At present, the available electrical supply is in variably 
three phase it is necessary to convert the 3 phase supply

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   list and interpret the four types of connections of primary and secondary windings 
*   state the phase and line values of current and voltage. 
There are various methods available for transforming 
3-phase voltages,   that   is for handling a considerable 
amountof power.   There are four possible ways in whichthe 
primary and   secondary windings of a group of three 
transformers may be connected together to transfer energy 
from one 3-phase circuit to another. They are: 
Primaries in ¥, Secondaries in Y 
Primaries in Y, Secondaries in A 
Primaries in A, Secondaries in A 
Primaries in A, Secondaries in Y. 
Star/Star or Y/Y connection: Fig 1 shows the connection 
of a bankof3 trans-formersina star-star. This connection 
is most economical for small, high voltage transformers 
because the number of turns per phase and the amount of 
insulation required is minimum. This connection works 
satisfactorily only if the load is balanced.   For a given 
voltage V between lines, the voltage across the terminals 
of a Y connected transformer is v/v3 the coil currentis 
equal to the liné current I.

 Star -   Delta   or   Y/A connection:   In   primary   side   3 
transformers are connected in star and the secondary 
consist of their secondary connected in delta as shown in 
Fig 2. The ratio between the secondary and primary line 
voltage is 1/,/3 times the transformation ratio of each 
transformer. There is a 30° shift between the primary and 
secondary line voltages. The main use of this connection 
is at the substation end of the transmission line.

 Delta - Delta or A/A connection:   Fig 3 shows three 
transformers, connected inA onboth primary and secondary 
sides.   There   is no angular displacement between the 
primary and secondary line voltages. Anadded advantage 
of this connection   is that if one transformer becomes 
disabled, the system can continue to operate in open- 
delta or in V-V. In V-V it can be operated with a reduced 
capacity of 58% and not 66.6% of the normal value.

 Delta - Star or   A/Y connection: (Fig 4) This connection 
is generally employed where it is necessary to   step up the

 The primary and secondary line voltages and line currents 
are out of phase with each other by 30°. The ratio of 
 secondary   to   primary   voltage   is   ,f3   times   the 
 transformation ratio of each transformer. 
 Parallel   operation   of 3-phase transformer 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain   parallel   opration 
¢   states the conditions for parallel operation of 3 phase transformer 
*   sates the necessity of parallel opertion. 
Parallel   operation 
Operating two or more transformers by connecting their 
primaries in paralleltoa commonsupply   line and connecting 
their respective secondaries in parallel with   a common 
load-busbars is calledas parallel operaion oftransformers. 
Conditions for pararllel opertion of transformers: 
Yvhen operating two or more transformer in parallel, the 
following conditions   have to   be satisfied for the   best 
performance of the transformer. 
1   The voltage ratio must be same. 
2   The per unit impedance or percentage impedance 
should be same i.e., the ratio between the equivalent 
leakage reactance and the equivalent resistance(X/ 
R)should be same. 
3   The polarities must be same. 
Forthree phase transformers 
i   The phase sequence must be same 
ii   The vector group must be same (i.e., The relative 
phase displacement between the secondary line 
voltages must be zero) 
Parallel operation of 3-phase transformer: 
Fig 1 shows the connection diagramfor parallel operation 
of twonumbers of 3-phase transformers. Inthis case, the 
connection of both of transformer 1   and 2 are (delta - 
star)jsame. 
However to operate the 2 transformers of having Y/A and 
connection, their primary and secondary line voltage A/Y 
must be same.   In this case,the turns ratio may not be 
equal, but the voltage ratio betweenthe terminal voltage of 
primary and secondary must be same. 
Iftwo transformers having different ratings, are connected 
in parallel the their percentage impedance must be same, 
where as the numerical impedance of transformer 1 will 
have half the impedance of transformer 2. Inthiscase both 
the transformers willshare the commonload in propertional 
to their KVA ratings. (Fig 1) 
Forbest performance of the parallel operation, the regulation 
of boththe transformers mustbe same.   Ifthe percentage 
impedance of both the transformers are different. Than one

 Natural air cooling method is generally adopted for love 
capacty   distribution transformer   upto   1OOKVA.   The 
natural circulation of the surrounding air is used to carry 
away the heat from the tran storm er vi nding. 
Inair blast method the fans are usedto blowthe air onthe 
Surface of the transtormer thereb ythe heat generated is 
carried away bythe air blast. 
Transformer of 200K above capacity are cooled by 
using aninsulating oil. The winding and core are immersed 
inoil. The area ofthe tank is increased by using cooling 
tubes. (Radiat ortubes)

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the transformer oil 
*   name three insulating oils used in transformer 
*   list the important properties of a transformers oil 
*   state the necessity of transformer oil 
*   state the causes for deterioration of oil 
*   explain the methods of testings the oil for its parameter. 
 Transformer oil 
 It is an insulating liquid,   used to cool and insulate the 
transformer windigs and core.A cooling   liquid   is also 
considered as a part of the transformer. 
Three kinds ofcooling cils/liquids are used intransformers 
today. 
¢   Mineraloil (inflammable) 
¢   Siliconliquids(low flammable) and 
*   Hydrocarbonliquids (non-flammable) 
The common transformer oil is a mineral oil obtained by 
refining crude petroleum.   Clean and dry mineral oil is an 
excellent insulator.   Its loss by evaporation is small.   But 
it is an inflammable liquid and readily absorbs moisture 
from the air.   Great care should be taken to keep the oil 
away from flame and moisture. 
synthetic liquids do not catchfire easily.   Synthetic liquids 
are therefore replace mineral transformer oils of those 
transformers used in 
*   underground mines 
*   refineries and hazardous location 
*   tunnels 
*   workshopandplants of metal processing theatres and 
cinemas etc. 
Transformer oil consists of organic compounds, namely 
paraffin, naphthalene and aromatics. Allthese are hydro 
carbons,   hence insulating oilfransformer oil/ synthetic 
transformer oilknownas ASKARELS and PYROCLORE 
are also in use. 
Properties of transformer oil 
Agood transformer oil should have the following properties. 
1   High   specific   resistance   so   that   high   insulation 
resistance 
Better heat conductivity, (i.e) higher specific heat. 
High   firing   point,   so that   not to   catch   fire   at   low 
temperature. 
4   [Do not absorb moisture easily, when exposed to air. 
5   Low viscosity 
Necessity of transformer oil: Large capacity distribution 
transformers produces more heat due to losses like core 
losses and copper losses, on load.   It is necessary to 
stablize the heat within temperature class by providing 
suitable insulating materials. 
Transformer oil acts as a good electrical insulating material. 
Thus it reduces electrical break down. Transformer oil will 
also act as cooling agent. Thus it brings thermal stability 
to all the internal parts of transformer. 
Causes for deterioration of transformer oil: Whenthe 
oil cooledtransformers are in use, the oils of the transformers 
are subjected to normal deterioration due tothe conditions 
of the use. 
For example 
1   The oil may come in contact with the air,   there by 
presence of moisture and dustinthe oil. The presence 
of   moisture   is   harmful   and   affects   the   electrical 
characteristics of oil and will accelerate deterioration of 
insulating materials. 
2   Sediment and precipitable sludge may be formed on 
the winding and core   surfaces.   It will   reduce the 
cooling rate and hence it may lead to deterioration of 
the insulating materials. 
3   Thepresenceofcertainsolidiron,   copper and dissolved 
metallic compounds will increase the acidity.   Insuch 
cases, theresistivity decreases, andelectrical strength 
also decreases, ancitis alsothe causes fordeterioration 
oftransformer ail. 
Testing   of transformer   oil:   For   reliable   use   and 
maintenance of   oil cooledtransformer, the transformer oil 
shall be tested before initial filling of tne oil as wellas during 
service of the transformers.   As per the test result it may 
be required to filter the transformer oil or in some cases, 
new   oil   may   be   recommended   for   safe   and   better 
maintenance   of oil cocledtransformers. 
The following tests are conducted periodically to decide 
the performance ofthe transformer oil. 
 1   Field test of insulation oil 
 Crackle test of insulating oil 2 
 3   Dielectric test of insulating oil 
4   Acidity test. 
 1   Field test of insulating oil 
Adropoftransformer oil, when placed slowly froma pipette 
on the still surface of a distilled water contained in heater 
should   retain its shape when the oil is new. 
Inthe case of used cyclo-octane oils (or) paraffin oils (even 
though unused) the drop usually flattened.   If this flattened 
drop occupies an area   of diameterless than 15to   18mm,

 Immediately after this, the oil is poured down into the test 
cell slowly in order to avoidair bubbles. The operation is 
carriedoutina dry place freefromdust. The oiltemperature 
at the time of test shall be same as that of ambient. 
After fulfilling the above conditions the cover of the cellis 
placed in position.   The cell is placed in the test unit and 
power is switched “ON”. 
The AC voltage across the electrode of frequency 40 to 
60Hz   is   increased uniformly at the rate of 2KV RMS 
starting from ‘OC’ upto the value of producing break down. 
The break down voltage is the voltage reached during the 
test atthe time the first spark occurs between electrodes. 
The circuitis openedautomatically ifanarc is established 
between electrodes. The break down voltage is recorded 
and the reading Is interpreted according to the standard 
ratings. The requirements as per IS-335-1983 is: Electrical 
Strength (break down voltage} 
 1   Newunfilteredtransformer oil   - 30KV (RMS) 
- 50KV (RMS) 
 It is recommended to filter the transformer oil if the break 
down voltage does not attain 30KV (RMS). 
The test shall be carried out 6 times onthe same   cell   filling. 
The electric strength shall be the arithmetic mean of the

The acid products are formed by the oxidation ofthe oil. 
 This oxidation will deteriorate the insulating materials like 
 insulating paper and press boards used in transformer 
windings.   Itis therefore essential to detect and monitor 
 the acidity formation. 
To conduct this   test portable test   kitis available consisting 
of: 
 1   Two polythene bottles containing   100ml each of ethy| 
 alcohol and sodium carbonate solution of 0.0085N 
concentration. 
An indicator bottle containing universal indicator. 
Four clean glass test tube. 
Three graduated droppers, which serves as pipettes.

 PROCEDURE 
 The test is conducted by taking 1.1 ml of insulating oil (to 
be tested)   intest tube,   8 ml oil 1 ml of rectified spirit is 
added and mixture isto be gently shakened. Further 1 ml 
of solution of 0.0085 N sodium carbonate added.   After 
shaking the test tube once again 5 drops of universal 
indicator is added.   The resulting mixture develops a 
colour depending on the acidity value of the mixture. 
The approximate colour range will be as follows: 
Total acidity value in No.   Colour 
 0.00   Black 
 02   Green 
05   Yellow 
1.0   Orange

 Rewinding of small transformer 
Itisnecessaryto re.ind   a transformer whenthe wind ing is 
burnt out or badly damaged. 
Vihile dismantling transformers, care should be takenta 
record the   necessary   particulars (data   by   which the 
rewinding   process   becomes   easy   and   the   original 
performance atthe transtonn eris assured. 
Recorndingthe data: The following data have ta be taken 
fromthetranstonn er betore andd uring disassembling. 
1)   Number ot windings turns   layers. 
Size of vires and insulation. 
Inpubtoutout voltages & currents. 
KA ratings.

STEPNO.3 
Determine the required cross-sectional area ofthe core of 
the transformer. 
For finding the cross-sectional area, certain parameters 
like the flux density of the metal used for laminations, 
frequency   of supply,   allowable   current density   in   the 
winding wire and power inputto the transformer neecto be 
 Known. 
 Cross section = 20 x 21=420 sq.mmor 4.2 sq. cm 
Table 1 gives the standard size of stampings having E and 
type laminations as available inthe marketwhichis given 
for your guidance.   Fig 2 gives the dimensions of the 
stampings.

 For the core area 4.248 sq.cm we can use the core of 
dimension having 20 mm as width and core thickness of 
21mm. 
The   nearest   size   sheet   should   be   selected from   the 
standard size of the stamping table. Here we assume the 
centre limb width to be 20 mm, andhence, the core E.|. 60 
isselected. However, youmay select any other type to suit 
the cross-section. Butthe other details like the number of 
stampings   and   the   bobbin   dimensions   may   change 
accordingly. 
 STEP NO.4 
 The next step is to calculate the voltage per turn using 
Formula 4. 
 e=444xBxAxfx10%   ....... Formula 4. 
 where e - voltage per turn 
B   - flux density in tesla 
 A- area of iron core in cm 
 f- frequency in Hertz 
Example 
e=444x08x 4.24 x 50 x 107 = 0.0753 volts.

Add 10% to compensate the voltage drop (internal) inthe 
secondary winding i.e. N, = 88 turns. 
 STEP NO.6 
 Calculate the size of wire with respect to the input power. 
P=Ex1|;1= P/E and according to the example, 
Primary current = |, = 15/240 = 0.0625A 
Secondary current = |, = 15/6 = 2.5A. 
Cross-section of primary conductor considering 3A/mm? 
as   current density will be 
 A = 0.0625/3 = 0.020833 mm 
 Diameter = 0.1628 mm 
Say ie. = 0.160 mm dia. or 37 SWG approximately 
Cross-section of secondary conductor considering 3A/ 
mmm?’ as current density will be 
 A= 2.5/8A = 0.8333 mr’ 
 Diameter = 1.0298 mm 
Say   = 1.00 mmdia. Hence 19 SWG.

the number of turns of primary and secondary within the 
winding space. 
Though the number of turns inthe primary is to be 3187 of 
37 SWG andthe secondary to be 88 turns of   19 SWG super 
enamelled copper wire,   it is atmost important to check 
whetherthese windings along with the respective insulation 
could be accommodated within the winding space ofthe 
core. This has to   be determined before taking   up the 
winding. 
CONCLUSION: For the transformeras inthe example, the 
derived winding data is as follows. 
Transformer rating 
Primary - 240V 
Secondary - 6V 
Frequency - 50 Hz 
 Volt ampere input-   15 VA 
 Core : Core area 20 x 21 mm as decided in Step 3. 
Bobbin: Breadth 20.6 mm, height21 mm, length26.7 mm 
andthe total   height of the   flange 42.7 mm as decided 
in step 7. 
Wire sizes and turns 
Primary - 3187 turns of size 0.16 mm or 37 SWG 
Secondary - 88 turns of size   1.00 mmor 19 SWG 
Stampings: Considering the thickness of each stamping 
as 0.35 mm, for the total thickness of 21   mm we may 
require 60 stampings. Considering the space between 
stampings and the stacking we may require 55 stampings 
only. Hence El 60/21 type 55 numbers of stampings having 
0.35 mm thickness are to be procured. 
Testing of transformer after rewinding: After rewinding 
the core assembly, the transformer is to be inspected for 
proper tightness of the core and coil as well as proper 
termination of the end leads. 
Insulation   resistance   test   ©   Insulation   resistance   is 
measured between windings and core with a 500 volts 
Megger. The reading so obtained shall be infinity ancdin no 
case below one megohm. 
Transformation   ratio test:   Keeping the transformer 
secondary open, the primary shall be connected to the 
rated AC voltage. Withthe help of suitable voltmeters both 
the primary and secondary voltage shall be measured. 
Load test : The transformer shall be connected with a 
suitable load, so thatthe fullload secondary current flows 
through   the secondary of the transformer winding. The 
raise in the winding temperature shall be observed   by a 
suitable industrial thermometer, onthe load. 
 The transformer temperature will raise initially and after 
 some time the temperature will come to a standstill. This 
raise intemperature shall be noted and itshall be withinthe 
limit of class of insulation of the transformer designed. 
Short circuit test |   VWhere it is not possible to load the 
transformer directly, the secondary winding of the trans- 
former shall be short circuited and the low voltage onthe 
primary shall be adjusted through a dimmerstat so that full 
load secondary currentflows through the secondary wind- 
ing ofthe transformer. The transformer so switchedon shall 
be tested for raise intemperature to ascertain the class of 
insulation. 
Generally oil-cooled transformers are of class- 
A where-as air-cooled   transformers   may   be 
 class ‘A’ or ‘E’.

General   maintenance   of   three-phase   transformers 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the need and advantages of maintenance of transformer 
*   state the factors affecting the life of transformers 
*   state the various periodical maintenance to be carried out in a transformer. 
Necessity of maintenance 
Power transformer is required to give a long and trouble 
free service,   It should be under constant attention and 
maintenance as It is a costly device. 
Arigid system of inspection and preventive maintenance 
will   ensure   long   life,   trouble   free   service   and   low 
maintenance cost.   Maintenance shall consists of regular 
inspection, testing and reconditioning wherever necessary. 
Principal object of maintenance:   The principal object 
of maintenance is to maintain the   insulation   in good 
condition.   Moisture, dirt and excessive heat in contact 
with oxygen are the main causes of insulation deterioration 
and avoidance of these will keep the insulation in good 
condition. 
There will be a decline in the quality of insulation during 
the ageing process due to chemical and physical effects. 
The decay ofthe insulation follows the chemical reaction 
rate and if the sustained operating temperature exceeds 
the normal operating temperature of 75°C by about 10°C 
the life of the transformer will get shortened. 
FACTORS AFFECTING   THE LIFE OF TRANSFORMERS 
 1   Effect of moisture 
 Transformer oil readily absorbs moisture from air.   The 
effect of water in the oil is to decrease the cielectric strength 
of the oil.   Therefore preventive steps should be taken to 
 guard against moisture penetration to the inside of 
 transformers. This will include blocking of all openings for 
free access of air and frequent reactivation of breathers in 
Service. 
2   Effect of oxygen 
Oxygen present inside the transformer due to air in oil, 
reacts on the cellulose of insulation. Due to decomposition 
of the cellulose product, an organic acid soluble in oil is 
formed which will   lead to a thick sludge.   This sludge 
blocks the free circulation of the oil and deposited in bottom 
there by causing damage to coils/cores. 
3   Effect of solid impurities 
The dielectric strength   of oil   is diminished   by   minute 
quantities of solid impurities present in the oil. Itis therefore 
a good practice to filter the oil after it has been in service 
for a short time. 
 290 
 4   Effect of varnishes 
 Some varnishes particularly of oxidizing type reacts with 
transformer oil and precipitate sludge on the windings. 
This should be kept in mind by the maintenance engineer 
when rewinding and replacing the coils during repairs. 
5   Effect of slackness of windings 
Slackness of windings may cause   a failure due to repeated 
movement of coils which may wear   the conductor insulation 
at some places and lead to an inter turn failure, momentary 
short circuit which   may cause electric and   magnetic 
unbalance.   It is a good practice to lift the core and windings 
of a transformer and take up any slackness which may 
have developed by tightening the tie rods. 
 MAINTENANCE PROCEDURE 
 1   Safety precautions 
i   Before starting any maintenance work the transformers 
should be isolated from the supply and the terminals 
 are earthed. 
 ii   The oillevel should be noted before unsealing the tank. 
iii   No fire should be kept near the transformer while main- 
tenance work is going on. 
2   Breather 
Generally two types of breathers are used namely 
a)   Silicagel breather 
b)   il filled silicagel breather 
a   Silica gel breather 
The colour of the crystals changes from blue to pink as 
the crystals absorbs moisture.   When the crystals gets 
saturated with moisture they become predominantly pink 
and it should be reactivated / reconditioned. 
b   Oil filled silicagel breather 
Oil available in the oil chamber attached with silicagel 
breather should be replaced, if it is gel condeminated. 
External connections: All terminal connections should 
be tight.   If they appear blackened or corroded, remove
