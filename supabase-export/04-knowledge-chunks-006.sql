 TASK 2: Preparation of bobbin 
1   Referring to the data taken in Table 5 and as per Fig 1, 
prepare the bobbin parts from a hylam/fibre sheet of 
the same thinckness. (Fig 2) 
 Bobbin   parts   of standard   sizes   are also 
 available   in   the   market   which   can   be 
assembled to form the bobbin. 
2   Assemble the parts of the bobbin as shown in Fig 2 
which Is given for your guidance. 
3   Check the   size of the assembled bobbin and verify it 
with the data taken and recorded in Table 5. 
In the case of an injuction moulded bobbin it 
can be purchased from the market assuming 
itis of standard size. 
TASK 3 : Rewinding of transformer 
1   Prepare/select a suitable mandrel for the prepared 
bobbin as shown in Fig 3 depending upon the design 
of the winding machines.

 Clamp the   mandrel/Awooden   block   in the winding 
machine. 
See to   it that while   clamping the mandrel 
under no circumstances the work becomes 
loose during winding. 
Fit the bobbin tightly to the mandrel of the winding 
machine with the help of fasteners as the bobbin must 
turn along with the mandrel without play. (Fig 4). 
Adjust the feed of the winding machine to suit the 
selected winding wire size   by friction drive or   by 
changing the gear as shown in number 1 of Figs 5 and 
 6. 
 Adjust the transverse feed of the winding machine 
guides such that the length of the inner side of the 
bobbin so as to maintain the length of the coil as in 
the original. Refer to number 2 of Figs 5 and 6. ‘You 
may need several trials before final setting.

 8   Start and continue the winding layer by layer providing 
the   necessary in-between   insulation and specified 
number of turms in each layer as per data taken in 
Table 4. 
9   Afterthe designated number of turns are wound, solder 
the end lead and take it out through the bobbin flange 
outlet. 
If a coil has a number of taps of winding, never 
cut the wire. Instead fold the length into along 
loop   and   carry   the wire   to   continue   the 
winding. The looped wire can then be bared 
 and connected outside the coil.

 10 After inspecting the primary winding,   wrap the winding 
as shown in Fig 7 with sufficient insulation according 
to the data taken in Table 4. 
 11   Select a suitable secondary winding wire as shownin 
 the data taken in Table 4 and proceed as in steps 4 
to 7. 
{2 Atthe end of the winding, wrap and bind the insulation 
onthe winding tightly. 
13   Inspect the coil for proper termination of lead and 
check the size by using a template and data taken in 
Table 3. 
14 Test the windings for continuity and short circuit. 
lf winding data is not available or a new transformer 
has to be designed and wound. 
If the winding wire thickness   is sufficiently 
large, soldering of connecting lead wire is not 
 necessary. 
 7   Start the winding and complete atleast one layer   to 
check whether the coil length is well within the bobbin 
as in the original. If not, readjust the transverse feed.

 Adjacent turns of the winding wire should not 
overlap or have a gap   in   between   them.   if 
incorrect, readjust the feed.

Safety practice - first aid 
E lectric shock 
We are aware that the prime reasons for severity of shock 
are the magnitude of current and duration of contact. In 
addition, the other factors contibute tothe severity ofshock 
 are: 
 =»   ageatperson 
»   body resistance

=»   Mains voltage etc. 
lfassistance is close at hand, send for medical aid, then 
carry on with em engency treatment. 
lfyou are alone, proceed sith the treatment immediately. 
hiake sure the wictim is notin contact with the supply. 
Effects of dectic shock 
The effect of current at very low levels may only be an 
unpleasant tingling   sensation, but this itself may be 
sufficient ta Cause some persons to lose their balance 
and fall. 
At higher level& of current the person receiving 4 shock 
may bethrown off his teet and wilexperience severe pain 
and possibly minor burns at the point of contact. 
Alan excessive shock can aleo cause burning ofthe skin 
atthe point of contact. 
Treatment of dectnic shock 
Prompt treatment is essential.

 Treatment for electrical burns 
 A person receiving an electric shock may also sustain 
burns when the current passes through the body. 
Do not waste time by rendering first aid to the 
victim until breathing has been restored and 
the patient can breathe normally unaided. 
Burns are very painful. Ifa large area of the body is burnt, 
do not give treatment, except to exclude the air, eg. by 
covering with clean paper ora clean cloth, soaked in clean 
water. this relieves the pain. 
Severe bleeding 
 Any wound which is bleeding profusely, especially in the 
 wrist,   hand or fingers must be considered serious and 
must receive professional attention. 
Immediate action 
Always in cases of severe bleeding 
-   make the patient to lle down and rest 
-   if possible, raise the injured part above the level of the 
body (Fig 1) 
-   apply pressure to the wound 
-   callfor medical assistance 
To control severe bleeding 
Squeeze together the sides of the wound. Apply pressure 
as long as it is necessary to stop the bleeding. When the 
bleeding has stopped, put a dressing over the wound and 
cover it with a pad of soft material. (Fig 2)

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the responsibilities of employer and employees 
 * state the safety attitude and list the four basic categories of safety signs. 
 Responsibilities 
Safety doesn''t just happen - it has to be organised and 
achieved like the work-process of which it forms a part. 
The law states that both an employer and his employees 
have a responsibility in this behalf. 
Employer''s responsibilities 
The effort a firm puts into planning and organising work, 
training people, engaging skilled and competent workers, 
maintaining plant and equipment, and checking, inspecting 
and keeping records - all of this contributes to the safety 
inthe workplace. 
The   employer will   be   responsible for the   equipment 
provided, the working conditions, what the employees are 
asked to do, and the training given. 
Employee''s responsibilities 
You will be responsible for the way you use the equipment, 
how you do your job, the use you make of your training, 
and your general attitude to safety. 
A great deal is done by employers and other people to 
make your working life safer; but always remember you 
are responsible for your own actions and the effect they 
have on others. You must not take that responsibility lightly. 
Rules and procedure at work 
What you must do, by law, is often included in the various 
rules and procedures laid down by your employer. They 
may be written down, but more often than net, are just the 
way a firm does things - you will learn these from other 
workers as you do your job. 
They may govern the issue and use of tools, protective 
clothing and equipment, reporting procedures, emergency 
drills, accéss to restricted areas, and many other matters. 
Such rules are essential; they contribute to the efficiency 
and safety of the job. 
Safety signs 
As you go about your work on a construction site you will

It is up to you to learn what 
they mean - and to take notice of them. They warn of the 
possible danger, and must not be ignored. 
Safety signs fall into four separate categories. These can 
be recognised by their shape and colour. Sometimes they 
may be just a symbol: other signs may include letters or 
figures and provide extra information such as the clearance 
height of an obstacle or the safe working load of a crane. 
The four basic categories of signs are as follows: 
*   prohibition signs (Fig 1 & Fig 5) 
*   mandatory signs (Fig 2 & Fig 6) 
*   warning signs (Fig 3 & Fig 7) 
*   information signs (Fig 4)

 Extreme caution is necessary in dealing with liquefied 
gases. There is a risk of explosion and sudden 
outbreak offire inthe entire vicinity. Ifan appliance 
fed froma   cylinder catches fire - shut off the supply 
of gas.   The safest course is to raise an alarm and 
leave the fire to be dealt with by trained personnel. 
Dry powder extinguishers are used on this type of 
fire.

 Special powders have now been developed which 
are capable of controlling and/or extinguishing this 
 type of fire. 
 The standard range of fire extinguishing agents is 
inadequate or dangerous when dealing with metal 
fires. 
Fire on electrical equipment. 
Halon, Carbon cioxide, dry powder and vapourising 
liquid (CTC) extinguishers can be used to deal with 
fires in electrical equipment.   Foam or liquid (eg. 
water) extinguishers must not be used on electrical 
equipment under any circumstances. 
Types of Fire Extinguisher

points: 
*   Preserve life: If the patient was breathing, a first aider 
would normally then place them   in the recovery position, 
withthe patient leant over on their side, which also has 
the effect of clearing the tongue from the pharynx.   It 
also avoids a common cause of death in unconscious 
patients, which is choking on regurgitated stomach 
contents. 
¢   Prevent further harm: Also sometimes called prevent 
the condition from worsening, or danger of further injury. 
*   Promote recovery: First aid also involves trying to 
start the recovery process from the illness or injury, 
and   in   some   cases   might   invelve   completing   a 
treatment, such as in the case of applying a plaster to 
asmall wound. 
 Training 
 Basic principles,   such as knowing to use an adhesive 
bandage or applying direct pressure on a bleed, are often 
acquired passively through life experiences. However, to 
provide effective, life-saving first aid interventions requires 
instruction and practical training. 
ABC of first aid 
ABC stands for Airway, Breathing and Circulation. 
*   Airway: Attention must first be brought to the airway 
to ensure it is clear.   Obstruction (choking) is a   life- 
threatening emergency. 
¢   Breathing: Breathing if stops, the victim may die soon. 
Hence means of providing support for breathing is an 
important   next steps.   There are several   methods 
practiced in first aid. 
¢   Circulation: Blood circulation is vital to keep person 
alive. The first aiders now trained to go straight to chest 
compressions through CPR methods. 
 Not to get panic 
 Panic is one emotion that can make the situation more 
worse. People often make mistake because they get panic. 
Call medical emergencies 
If the   situation   demands,   quickly   call   for   medical 
assistance. Prompt approach may save the life. 
Surroundings play vital role 
Different surrouncings require different approach. Hence 
first aider should study the surrounding carefully. 
 Do no harm 
 Most often over enthusiastically practiced first aid viz. 
administering water when the victim is unconscious, wiping 
clotted blood (which acts as plug to reduce bleeding), 
correcting fractures, mishandling injured parts etc., would 
leads to more complication. 
 Reassurance 
 Reassure the victim by speaking encouragingly with him. 
Stop the bleeding 
If the victim is bleeding, try to stop the bleeding by applying 
pressure over the   injured part. 
 Golden hours 
 India have best of technology made available in hospitals 
to treat devastating   medical   problem viz.   head   injury, 
multiple trauma,   heart attack, strokes etc,   but patients 
often do poorly because they don''t gain access to that 
technology intime. 
The risk of dying from these conditions, is greatest in the 
first 30 minutes, often instantly. This period is referred to 
as Golden period. 
Maintain the hygiene 
Most important, the first aider need to wash hands and 
dry before giving any first aid treatment to the patient. 
CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation) can be life- 
sustaining 
CPR can be life sustaining. If one is trained in PR and the 
person   is suffering from   choking or finds difficulty in 
breathing, immediately begin CPR. 
Call emergency service 
The emergency number varies - 100 for Police & Fire, 108 
for Ambulance. 
Report your location 
The first thing the emergency dispatcher will ask is where 
you are located, so the emergency services can get there 
as quickly as possible. Give the exact street address, if 
you''re not sure of the exact address, give approximate 
information. 
Give the dispatcher your phone number 
This information is also imperative for the dispatcher to 
have, so that he or she is able to call back if necessary. 
Important guideline for first aiders 
Evaluate the situation 
Are there things that might put the first aider at risk. When 
faced with accidents like fire, toxic smoke, gasses, an 
unstable building, live electrical wires or other dangerous 
scenario, the first aider should be very careful not to rush 
into a situation, which may prove to be fatal. 
 Remember A-B-Cs 
 The ABCs of first aid refer to the three critical things the 
first aiders need to look for. 
*   Airway - Does the person have an unobstructed airway’? 
*   Breathing - ls the person breathing’? 
*   Circulation - Does the person show a pulse at major 
pulse points (wrist, carotid artery, groin) 
Call emergency services : Call for help or tellsomeone 
else to call for help as soon as possible. If alone at the

 Recycling 
Recycling   is one   of the   most well   known   method   of 
managing waste.   It is not expensive and can be easily 
done by you. If you carry out recycling, you will save a   lot 
of energy, resources and thereby reduce pollution. 
Composting 
This is a natural process that is completely free of any 
hazardous by-products. This process involves breaking 
down the material into organic compounds that can be 
used as manure. 
 Landfill 
 In this process, the waste cannot be reused or recycled 
separated out and spread as a thin layer in some low- 
lying areas across the city. 
Incineration (Fig 3) 
 Itis the process of controlled combustion of garbage to 
 reduce it to incombustible matter,   ash, waste gas and 
heat.   It is treated and released into the environment 
(Fig 3). This reduced 90% volume of waste, some time 
the heat generated used to produce electric power.

 Waste compaction 
The waste materials such as cans and   plastic   bottles 
 compact into blacks and send for recycling. This process 
 need space, thus making transportation and positioning 
 difficult. 
 Reuse 
 The amount of waste disposal can be reduced by carefully 
considering the exact throwing away. Before discarding 
the item think for the possibility to wash and reuse them. 
 Animal   Feed: 
 Vegetable peel and food scraps can be retained to feed 
small animals such as lamsters rabbit etc. Large meat 
bones will be greately reused by feeding dog. 
 Fire Wood: 
 Asmall amount of waste disposal can be reused when it 
comes to refurnishing have or replacing furniture. before

Personal Protective E quipment (PPE) 
The Devices, equipment, ar clothing used or worn by the 
employees as alast resort, to protect against hazards in 
the workplace. The primary approach inany safety effort 
iz that the hazardtothe workmen should be eliminated or 
controlled by engineering methods ratherthan protecting 
the   workmen through the   use   of personal   protective 
equipment (PF PE). 
In   Stuations where   itis not   possible to   introduce   ary 
effective engineering methods for controlling hazards, the 
workinan shall use appropriate types of PPE . 
The Factores Ad   1946 and several dher labour legisatians

 18 Hacksaw frame and blade 
 The hand hacksaw is used along witha blade to cut metals 
of different sections.   It is also   used to cut slots and 
contours. 
Types of hacksaw frames 
Bold frame: Only a particular standard length of blade can 
 be fitted. 
 Adjustable frame (flat):   Different standard lengths of 
blades can be fitted. 
Adjustable frame tubular type   (Fig 18): This is the most 
commonly used type. Itgivesa better gripandcontrol while 
sawing.

 Hacksaw blades : The hacksaw blade is a thin, narrow, 
steel band with teeth and two pin holes at the ends.   It is 
 usedalong witha hacksaw frame. These blades are made 
 of eitherlow alloy steel (la) or highspeed steel (hs) andare 
available in standard lengths of 250mmand 300mm. 
For proper working, itis necessary to have frames of rigid 
construction. 
 Standard   and   standardisation 
 Types of hacksaw blades 
 All-hard   blades:   The width   between the pin   holes is 
hardened all allong the length of the blade. 
Flexible blades: For these types of blades only the teeth 
are hardened. Because oftheirflexibility, these blades are 
useful for cutting along curved lines (Fig 19).

 Saw blades forhacksaws are available with small and large 
cutting of teeth, depending onthe type and size of material 
they are to cut.   The size of the teeth is directly related to 
their pitch, which is specified by the number of teeth per 
Zomm ofthe cutting edge. Hacksaw blades are avaialable 
in pitches of: (Fig 20)

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state what is meant by standardisation and standard 
*   state the names of various standard organisation 
*   read and interpret the basic concept of electrical code 2011 
*   state the types of injury caused by the improper lifting method 
*   describe the procedure to be followed for moving heavy equipments. 
Standardisation   can   be   defined   as   the   process   of 
formulating and applying rules for an orderly approach to 
specific   activity   for   the   benefit   of the   user   and   the 
manufacturer, andin particular forthe promotion of optimum 
overall   economy taking due account of functional conditions 
and safety requirement. 
Itis based onthe consolidated results of science, technique 
and experience.   It determines not only the basis for the 
present but also forfuture development, andto keep pace 
with progress.

Lifting and handling of loads 
Many of the accidents reported involve injuries caused by 
lifting and carrying loads. Aelectrician may need to install 
motors, lay heavy cables, do wiring, which may involvea   lot 
of lifting andcarrying of loads. VVrong liftingtechniques can 
result in injury. 
Aload need not necessarily be very heavy to cause Injury. 
The wrong way of lifting may cause injury to the muscles 
and joints even though the load is not heavy. 
Further injuries during lifting and carrying may be caused 
by tripping over an object and falling or striking an object 
with a load. 
Crushing of feet or hands 
Feet or hands should be so positioned that they will not be 
trapped by the load. Timber wedges can be used when 
raising and lowering heavy loads to ensure fingers and 
hands are not caught and crushed. 
Safety shoes with steel toe caps will   protect the feet.

 Preparaing to lift:   Load which seems light enough to 
carry atfirst will become progressively heavier, the farther 
you have to carry it. 
The person who carries the load should always be able to 
see over or around it. 
The weight that a person can lift will vary according to: 
-   Age 
-   Physique, and 
-   Condition 
It will also depend on whether one is used to lifting and 
handling heavy loads. 
What makes an object difficult to lift and carry? 
1   Weight is not the only factor which makes it difficult to 
lift and carry. 
2   The size and shape can make an object awkward to 
handle. 
3   Loads high require the arms to be extended in front of 
the body, place more strain on the back and stomach. 
4   The absence of hand holds or natural handling points 
can make it difficult to raise and carry the object. 
Correct manual lifting techniques 
1   Approach the load squarely, facing the direction of 
travel 
2   Theliftshould start withthe   lifter ina balanced squatting 
position, with the legs slightly apart and the load to be 
lifted held close to the body. 
3   Ensure thatasafefirmhand gripis obtained. Before the 
weight is taken, the back should be straightened and 
held as near the vertical position as possible. (Fig 2) 
4   Toraisethe load, first straighten the legs. This ensures 
that the lifting strain is being correctly transmitted and 
is   being taken   by the   powerful   thign   muscles and 
bones. 
5   Look   directly   ahead,   not   down   at   the   load   while 
straightening up, and keep the back straight; this will 
ensure asmooth, natural movementwithout jerking or 
straining (Fig 3) 
6   Tocomplete the lift, raise the upper part of the body to 
the vertical position. Whenaloadisnearto anindividual''s 
maximum lifting capacity it will be necessary to lean 
back on the hips slightly (to counter balance the load) 
before straightening up. (Fig 4) 
Keeping the loadwell near to the body, carry itto the place

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the types of hand drilling machines and their uses 
*   state the parts of bench and pillar drilling machine 
*   explain the features of machine vice 
Making holes in sheet metal by using solid punches is a 
slow and inefficient process. 
It is necessary to drill   holes when working with heavy 
material. 
The heles can be drilled by hand or by machine. When 
drilling by hand,   a hand drilling machine (Fig 1) or the 
electric hand drilling machine (Fig 2) is used. 
Twist drills are Used as acuttingtool for drilling holes. The 
hand drillis used for drilling holes upto 6.5 mm diameter. 
The portable electric hand drilling machine is a very popular 
and useful power tool.   It comes in different sizes and 
capacities. 
The handle shown in Fig 2 is called a pistol grip handle. 
The parts of anelectric hand machine are shown in Fig 2. 
Precautions to be observed : Make sure the holes are 
properly located and   punched with a centre punch. 
Be sure the drillis properly centred inthe chuck by turning 
(rotating). 
Be sure the work is mounted properly ina holding device 
such as a vice or G'' clamp. 
Check the centering of the drill after the point has just 
started inthe metal. Relocate the hole witha centre punch, 
if necessary. Feed the drill with a light, even pressure.

 This machine is capable of drilling holes up to 12.5mm 
diameter. The arills are fitted inthe chuck or directly inthe 
tapered hole of the machine spindle. 
The pillar drilling machine: This is an enlarged version 
of the sensitive   bench drilling machine.   These drilling 
machines are mounted onthe floor andare driven by more 
powerful electric motors.   They are used for heavy duty 
work.   Pillar drilling machines are available in different

Introduction: Electricity is one ofthe today''s moat useful 
sourcezotenergy. Electricity izatutmost necessityin the 
modern worldot sophisticated equip mentand machinery. 
Electricity inmotion is called electric current. “whereasthe 
electricity that does not move is called static electricity.

Structure of matter: Electricity is related to some ofthe 
most   basic   building   blocks   of matter that   are   atoms 
(electrons   and   protons).   All matter   is made   of these 
electrical building blocks and therefore, all matter iz said 
to be ‘electrical’. 
Atoms Matter is defined as anything that has mass and 
occupies space.   A   matter is made   of   tiny, invisible 
particles called molecules. 4 molecule is the smallest 
particle of a   substance that has the   properties of the 
substance. Each molecule can   be divided into simpler 
partsby chemicalm eans.T he simplest parts of amale cule 
are called atoms. 
Basically,   an atom   contains three tyes of sub-atom ic 
particles that are ofrelevanceta electricity. They are the 
electrons, protons and neutrons. The protonsand neutrons 
are located inthe centre, or nudeus, ofthe atom, and the 
electrons travel around the nucdeusin orbits. 
 Atomic structure

 Energy shells 
Invan atom , electrons are arranged in shells around the 
nudeus. A shellisan orbiting la yer or energy level   of one 
ormore electrons. The major shelllayersare identifiedby 
numbersoar byletters starting vith ''K'' nearest the nucleus 
and continuing alpnabetically outwards. There i sam anim um

 Similarly an aluminium atom which has 13 electrons has 
3 shells as shown in Fig 5. 
Electron   distribution:   The   chemical   and   electrical 
behaviour of atoms depends onhow completely the various 
shells and sub-shells are filled. 
Atoms that are chemically active have one electron more 
or one lessthana completely filledshell.   Atoms that have 
the outer shell exactly filled are chemically inactive. They 
are calledinertelements. Allinertelements are gases and 
do not combine chemically with other elements. 
Conductors, insulators and semiconductors 
Conductors: A conductor is a material that has many 
valance electrons permitting electrons to move through it 
easily. Generally, conductors have many valence shells of 
one, twoor three electrons.   Most metals are conductors. 
Some commen good conductors are Copper, Aluminium, 
Zinc, Lead, Tin, Eureka, Nichrome, are conductors, where 
as silver and gold are very good conductors 
Insulators: An insulator is a material that has few, if any, 
free electrons and resists the flow of electrons. Generally, 
insulators have full valence shells of five, six or seven 
electrons. Some common insulators are air, glass, rubber, 
plastic, paper, porcelain, PVC, fibre, mica etc. 
Semiconductors:A semiconductor is a material that has 
some of the characteristics of both the conductor and 
insulator. Semiconductors have valence shells containing 
four electrons. 
Common examples of pure semiconductor materials are 
siliconand germanium. Specially treated semiconductors 
are used to produce modern electronic components such 
as diodes, transistors and integrated   circuit chips.

 Simple electrical circuit and its elements 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   describe a simple electric circuit 
*   explain the current, its units and method of measurement (ammeter) 
*   explain the emf, potential difference, their units and method of measurement (voltmeter) 
*   explain resistance and its unit, and quantity of electricity. 
Simple electric circuit 
Asimple electrical circuit is oné in which the current flows 
from the source to a load and reaches back the source to 
complete the path. 
A simple electrical circuit is shown in Fig 1 
Electric current 
Fig 2 shows a simple circuit which consists of a battery as 
the energy source and a lamp as the resistance. In this 
circuit, whenthe switch is closed, the lamp glows because 
of the electric current flows from the +ve terminal of the 
source (battery) via the lamp and reaches back the -ve 
terminal of the source. 
Flow of electric current is nothing but the flow of free 
electrons. Actually the electrons flow is fromthe negative 
terminal of the battery tothe lamp and reaches backtothe 
positive terminal of the battery. 
However direction of current flow is taken conventionally 
from the +ve terminal of the battery to the lamp and back 
to the -ve terminal ofthe battery. Hence, we can conclude

 Ampere 
The unit of current (abbreviated as |) is anampere (symbol 
A). lf 6.24   10" electrons pass through a conductor per 
second having one chm resistance witha potential difference 
of one volt causés one ampere current has passed through 
the conductor. 
 Ammeter 
 We know the electrons cannot be seen and no human 
being can count the electrons.   As such an instrument 
called ammeter is used to measure the current ina circuit. 
Asanammeter measures the flow of current in amperes It 
should be connected in series with the resistance (Load)

electromeotive force (emf) which is availabletodrivethefree 
electrons in the closed path of the electrical circuit. The 
difference in the distribution of electrons between the two 
terminals of the battery produces this emf.

 Electro Motive Force (EMF) 
Inorder to move the electrons ina circuit- that is to make 
the currentto flow, a source ofelectrical energy is required. 
In a torch   light,   the battery   is the   source of electrical 
 energy. 
 Within the   battery the   negative terminal   contains   an 
excess of electrons whereas the positive terminal has a 
In Simple, 
Electromotive force (EMF) is the electrical force, whichis 
initially available inelecricalsource, causeto move thefree 
electrons in a conductor 
Its unit is “Volt 
It is denoted by letter ‘E’ 
It   cannot   be   measured   by any   meter.   It   can   be only 
calculated by using the formula 
E = Potential Difference (P.D}) + V. drop

 Electrometive force is essential to drive the electrons in 
circuit 
 System International (SI) unit of electromotive force is 
Volts (symbol ‘E’) 
Potential Difference (PD) 
The difference of volatge and pressure across two points in 
a   circuit   is   called   a   potential   difference   (p.d}   and   is 
measured in volts. 
Inacircuit, when a current flows, there will be a potential 
difference across the terminals of the resistor/load. In the 
circuitshowninFig4, whenthe switch isin open conidition, 
the voltage   across the   terminals of the   cell   is   called 
electromotive force (E) whereas when the switch is in the 
closed   position,   the   voltage   across the   cell   is   called 
potential difference (p.d) which wil be lesser in value than 
the electromotive force earlier measured. This is duetothe 
fact that the internal resistance of the cell drops a fer volts 
when the cell supplies current to the load. 
The force which causes current to flow in the circuit is 
called emf. Its symbol is E and its unitis Volts (V). It can 
be calculated as 
EMF=   voltage atthe terminal of source of supply +

It is the voltage available at the terminal of the source of 
supply. Its symbol is V_. Its unit is also the volt and is also 
measured by a voltmeter. It is given by the emf minus the 
voltage drop in the source of supply, i.e. 
 y= EMF-IR

 Conductance 
 The property of a conductor which conducts the flow of 
current through itis called conductance. In other words, 
 conductance is the reciprocal of resistance. Its symbol is 
 G (G= 1/R) and its unit is mho represented by 7}.   Good 
conductors have large conductances and insulators have 
small conductances. Thus if a wire has a resistance of R 
£2, its conductance will be 1/R 
 Quantity of electricity 
 As the current is measured in terms of   the rate of flow of 
electricity, another unit is necessary to denote the quantity 
of electricity (Q) passing through any part of the circuit in 
a certain time. This unit is called the coulomb (C).   It is 
denoted by the letter Q. Thus 
Quantity of electricity = current in amperes (1)

Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the difference types of electrical supply 
*   differentiate between alternating current and direct current 
*   explain the method of identification of polarity in DC source 
 ¢   state the effect of electric current 
 Type of electrical supply (Voltage) 
There are two types of electrical supply in use for various 
technical   requirements. The alternating current supply 
(AC} and the direct current supply (DC). 
DC is represented by this symbol. 
~   AC is represented by this symbol. 
DC Supply 
The most common sources of DC supply are the cells/ 
batteries (Figs   1a and   1b) and DC generators (dynamos). 
 (Fig1C) 
 Direct voltage is of constant magnitude (amplitude).   It 
remains at the   same   amplitude   from the   moment   of

 The polarity of direct voltage (commonly known as DC 
voltage) is positive (+ve) andnegative (-ve). The direction 
of conventional flow of current istaken as fromthe positive 
to the negative terminal outside the source. (Fig 3)

 Thus direct current remains at the same value from the 
moment of switching on to the moment of switching off. 
(Direct currentincommon usage is knownasDC current. ) 
AC Supply 
The source of AC supply is AC generators (alternators). 
(Fig 4a) The supply froma   transformer (Fig 4b) is also AC. 
Alternating voltage 
AC supply sources change their polarity constantly, and 
consequently the direction of voltage also magnitude. The 
voltage suppliedto our homes by power plantsis alternating. 
Fig 5 shows a sinusoidal alternating voltage over time 
(wave-form).

AC VOLTAGE 
 AC supply is expressed by the effective value ofthe voltage, 
andthe number of times It changes in one secondis known 
as frequency. Frequency is represented by ''F'' and its unit 
is in HertzZ(HzZ). 
AC supply terminals are   marked as phase/line(L) and 
neutral(N). 
 ELN132138 
 Current is caused in an electric circuit due to the applica- 
tion of voltage. If an alternating voltage is applied to an 
electrical circuit, analternating current (commonly known 
as AC current) will flow. (Fig 6)

 Importance of the polarity 
Direct   current supply   has fixed   polarity,   positive   and 
negative marked as + and — Electric devices which have 
positive and negative identifications ontheirterminalsare 
said to be polarised. When connecting such devices toa 
source of voltage (such as a battery or DC supply) 
Ve must observe the correct polarity markings. That isthe 
positive terminal of the device must be connected to the 
positive terminal of the source, and the negative to the 
negative.   If the polarity is not observed correctly (that is, 
if+ve is connected to -ve) the device will not function and 
may be damaged. 
 Effects of electric current 
 When an electric current flows through a   circuit, is judged 
by its effects, which are given below. 
 1   Chemical effect 
 When an electric current is passed through a conducting 
 liquid   (Le.   acidulated water) called an electrolyte,   it is 
decomposed into its constituents due to chemical action. 
The   practical   application   of   this   effect   is   utilized   in 
electroplating,   block   making,   battery   charging,   metal 
refinery, etc. 
2   Heating effect 
Vvhen an electric potential is applied to a conductor, the 
flow of electrons is opposed   by the   resistance   of the 
conductor and thus some heat is produced.   The heat 
produced   may   be   greater   or   lesser   according to   the 
circumstances, but some heat is always produced. The 
application ofthis effect is in the use of electric presses, 
heaters, electric lamps, etc. 
3   Magnetic effect 
Vvhen a   magnetic compass is placed under a current 
carrying wire, itis deflected. It snows that there is some 
relation between the current and magnetism. The wire 
 carrying current does not become magnet but produces a 
 magnetic field inthe space. Ifthis wire is wound on aniron 
core (i.e. bar), itbecomes anelectro-magnet. This effect of 
electric current is applied in electric bills,   motors, fans, 
electric instruments, etc. 
 4   Gas ionization effect 
 VYhen electrons pass through a certain gase sealed ina 
glass tube, it becomes ionised and starts emitting light 
rays, suchas influorescenttubes,   mercury vapour lamps, 
sodium vapour   lamps, neon lamps, etc. 
5   Special rays effect 
Special   rays   like   X-rays   and   laser   rays   can   also   be 
developed by means of an electric current. 
 6   Shock effect 
 The flow of current through the human body may cause a 
severe shock or even death in many cases. If this current 
iscontrolled to a specific value, this effect of current can be 
used to give light shocks to the brain for the treatment of 
mental patients. 
 Conducting   materials and their comparison 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   differentiate between conducting and insulating materials 
*   state the electrical properties of conducting materials 
*   state the characteristics of copper and aluminium conductors 
*   state the types and propertites of insulating materials. 
*   describe the method of measurement of wire size using SWG 
*   explain the method of measure wire size by outside micrometer 
 Conductors and insulators 
 Material with high electron mobility (many free electrons) 
are called conductor. 
Materials that contain many free electrons and are capable 
of carrying an electric current are known as conductors. 
Examples - silver,   copper,   aluminium and   most other 
metals. 
Materials   with   low   electron   mobility   (few   (or)   no free 
electron) are called insulators 
Materials that have only afew electrons and are incapable 
of allowingthe current to pass through them are knownas 
insulators.

Inelectrical work, mostly copper and aluminium are used 
for conductors.   Though silver is a better conductor than 
copper, it is not used for general work due to higher cost. 
Copper used in electrical work is made with a very high 
degree of purity, say 99.9 percent. 
Characteristics of copper 
1   It has the best conductivity next to silver. 
2   Ithasthelargest current density per unitarea compared 
to other metals. Hence the volume required to carry a 
given current is less fora given length. 
 It can be drawn into thin wires and sheets. 
 It has a   high   resistance to atmospheric corrosion: 
hence, it can serve for a long time. 
 5   Itcanbe joined withoutany special provision to prevent 
 electrolytic action. 
6   Itis durable and has a high scrap value. 
Next to copper, aluminium is the metal used for electrical 
conductors. 
 Characteristics of aluminium 
 1   Ithas good conductivity, nextte copper. Whencompared 
to copper, ithas 60.6 percent conductivity.   Hence, for 
the same current capacity, the cross-section for the 
aluminiumwire should be larger than that for the copper 
 wire. 
 It is lighter in weight. 
Itcan be drawn inte thin wires and sheets. But loses its 
tensile strength on reduction of the cross-sectional 
 area. 
 4   Alotof precautions needs to be followed while joining 
aluminiumconductors. 
5   Themelting point of aluminium is low, hence it   may get 
damaged at points of loose connection due to heat 
developed. 
6   Itis cheaper than copper. 
Table 1 shows the properties of copper compared with 
those of aluminium.

Properties of insulating materials 
Two fundamental properties of insulation materials are 
insulation resistance and dielectric strength.   They are 
entirely differentfromeach other and measured in different 
 ways. 
 Insulationresistance 
 Megohmmeter (Megger) is the instrument used to mea- 
sure insulation resistance.   It measures high resistance 
values inmegohms without causing damage to the insula- 
tion. The measurement serves as a guide to evaluate the 
condition ofthe insulation. 
Dielectric strength 
It is the measure of how much potential difference the 
insulation layer can withstand without breaking down. The 
potential difference that causes a breakdown is called the 
breakdown voltage ofthe insulation. 
Every   electrical   device   is   protected   by some   kind   of 
insulation. The desirable characteristics of insulation ma- 
terials are: 
*   highdielectric strength 
*   resistance to temperature 
 flexibility 
 *   mechanical strength. 
No single material has all the characteristics required for 
every application. Therefore,   many kinds of insulating 
materials have been developed. 
Measurement of wire sizes - standard wire gauge - 
outside micrometer 
Necessity of measuring the wire sizes 
A proper estimate involves determination of current in 
different loads, correct selection of the type of cable, size 
of the cable and the required quantity. Any error will result 
indefective wiring, fire accidents and bring unhappinesste 
both the house owner and the electrician. 
Asound knowledge about the area of the cross-sectionof 
the core, the diameter   ofthe single strand of the conductor 
andthe number of conductors in each core of the stranded

To measure the size of conductors, a electrician can use 
normally a standard wire gauge or an outside micrometer 
for more accurate results. 
Standard Wire Gauge (SWG) 
The size of the conductor is given by the standard wire 
gauge number. According to the standards each number 
has an assigned diameter in inch or mm. This is given in 
Table 1. The standard wire gauge, shownin Figure 1 could 
measure the wire size in SVVG numbers from 0   to 36. It 
should be noted that the higher the number of wire gauge 
the smaller is the diameter of the wire. 
For example, SVG No. 0 (zero) is equal to 0.324 inch or 
8.23 mm in diameter whereas SVWG No.36 is equal to 
0.0076 inch or 0.19 mmin diameter. 
While measuring the wire, the wire should be cleaned and 
then inserted into the slot ofthe wire gauge to determine the 
 SVVG number.

 STANDARD WIRE GAUGE 
 Measurement of wire size by outside mirometers : A 
micrometer is a precision instrument used to measure a 
job, generally within an accuracy of 0.01 mm. 
Micrometers used to take the outside measurements are 
known as outside micrometers. (Fig 2)

OUTSIDE MICROMETER - PARTS  ELN1321741 
 Principle of the micrometer : The micrometer works on 
the principle of screw and nut. The longitudinal movement 
ofthe spindle during one rotation is equal tothe pitch of the 
screw. The movement of the spindle to the distance of the 
pitch or its fractions can be accurately measured on the 
barrel andthimble.

The distance moved by the spindle during one rotation of 
the thimble is 0.5 mm.

 Precautions to be followed while using a micrometer 
Before   using   the   micrometer   for   measurement,   it   is 
necessary   to   ascertain   that there   is   no   error   in   the 
micrometer.   To   find   the   error,   close   the jaws   of the 
measuring surfaces using the ratchet. Readthe micrometer. 
If the thimble Zero is coincident with the datum line of the 
barrel, error iszero. If itreads higher value, the error is +ve; 
if   treads lesser value the difference between zero andthe 
read value is -ve error. 
Ifthere is minus error itshould be addedto   the total reading 
andifthere is plus errorthe value should be subtracted from 
the total reading. 
The faces of the anvil and spindle must be free from dust, 
dirt and grease. 
While reacing the micrometer, the spindle must be locked

 Objective:   At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the method of skinning of cable. 
While, using aluminium cables proper care is to be taken 
regarding the following. 
*   Handling 
¢   Skinning of the cables 
*   Connecting the cable ends 
Handling: Remember that aluminium conductors when 
compared to copper conductors have less tensile strength 
andless resistance to fatigue. Assuch, bending or twisting 
ofaluminiumconductors while laying the cables should be 
avoided as far as possible. 
Skinning of cables: VVhile skinning the insulation from 
the cables, knicks and scratches should be avoided. As 
shownin Fig 1, the insulation should not be ringed as there 
is a danger of   nicking the aluminium conductor while 
ringing the insulation with a knife. 
Using the knife as shown in Fig 2 at an angle of 20°to the 
axis of the core will avoid knicking of the conductor.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to: 
*   state the necessity of proper termination 
*   list the different types of terminations 
*   describe the parts and their functions of crimping tool 
*   state the advantages of crimping termination 
Necessity of termination 
Cables areterminated atelectrical appliances, accessories 
and equipment etc. for providing electrical connections. All 
terminations must be   made to provide good electrical 
continuity,   and made   in such a   manner as to   prevent 
contact with other metallic parts and other cables. 
Loose terminations willleadto overheating of cables, plugs 
and other connecting points due to higher resistance at 
those terminations. Fires may also be started due to the 
excess heat. VVrong termination like excess or extended 
conductor touching metallic part of the equipment may 
lead to giving shock to the person whe comes in contact 
with the equipment. 
Toconclude, we can state that wrong termination willlead 
to overheating of terminating points and cables,   short 
circuits and earth leakage. 
 Types of termination 
 Crimp connection: Inthistype of connectionthe conductor 
is inserted into a crimp terminal and is then crimped with 
a crimping tool (Fig 1). 
Itis important to choose a crimpterminal that matches the 
conductor diameter andthe dimensions of the connecting 
screw terminal. (Figs 2 & 3)

 Screw on terminals with loop/ring conductor: A loop 
 is formed clockwise in the bare portion of the conductor to 
 match the size of the screw diameter. Then the loop is 
inserted to the screw and tightened. (Fig 5) Inthe case of 
a stranded conductor, soldering of the loop is essential to 
prevent strands gettingfray.

 Crimping and crimping tool 
The ends of cables can be prepared for termination with 
lugs by the saldering process or by mechanical means - 
compression or crimp fitting. 
Incrimpcompressionfitting, a ring-tongued terminal (lug) 
isto be compressed to the bared end of aninsulated multi- 
strand cable. The process is called crimping and the tool 
used is called crimping pliers or crimping tool. 
The principal   purpose of the pressure is to establish and 
maintain   suitable   low contact   resistance   between the 
contact surfaces of the conductor.   Improper crimping will 
create   increased   contact   resistance   and   will   cause 
overheating while carrying electrical load. 
Crimping tools 
The crimping pliers illustrated in Fig 7 is of a type which 
crimps from 0.5 to   6 mm cables. 
 Fig 7 
 HAND CRIMPING PLIERS  ELN1321A41 
 The tool is operated by squeezing the handles. The jaws 
move together, grip and then crimp the fitting. Using the 
crimping tool that matches the specific crimp lug will give 
the correct crimping force for a properly executed crimp. 
Properly executed crimp will indent the top ofthe lug and 
the indentation will hold the conductor securely as shown 
in Fig 8.

 from 26 to 10 SWG. 
 The head and jaws, may be removed, by unscrewing the 
screws S, and S,.   Ahead with different shaped jaws may 
then   be secured to the tool.   The   shape   of the jaws

 Terminal types 
It   is   important to   consider   both   the   mechanical   and 
electrical requirements when selecting a lug connector. 
The factors are: 
*   the type of tongue, |e. rectangular, ring, spade, etc. 
¢   the mechanical size, i.e. tongue size and thickness, 
hole size etc. for the cable selected 
«   theelectrical considerations suchasthe current carrying 
capacity,   that   may   also   determine   some   of   the 
mechanical dimensions. 
The electrical and mechanical requirements forthe lug and 
the base material of the lug are decided by the cable 
 Cable insulation - voltage grading 
 material, and the place of connection will determine the 
minimum   tongue   size   and the   barrel   size.   The   most 
commonly used base materials are copper and brass. 
Nickel,   aluminium   and   steel   are   also   used,   but   less 
frequently. 
Fig   12 shows some   lug connectors   normally   used   in 
practice terminals.   They are   ring,   rectangular,   space, 
flanged space etc.

Precautions for crimping tool application 
De not handle the job/tocl roughly e.g. drop, hammer, etc. 
which may harm the tool. 
De net alter the crimping tool, e.g. alterthe shape of the die 
etc. 
De netlet metal chips adhere to the working position ofthe 
tool, particularly onthe lower surface of replaceable die on 
the crimping part. 
Ifa pin, spring, etc. is found damaged inthe crimping tool, 
repair it immediately. 
Apply oxide inhibiting grease to the aluminium conductor 
end just before crimping. 
Advantages of crimping terminations 
1   Aproperly made crimpis better inelectrical conductivity 
and mechanical strength. 
Less costly. 
3   When the same   size   cables are   to   be terminated 
through lug connectors, the crimping process is faster 
thansoldering. 
Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   list out the factors for selection of cables 
*   state voltage grading. 
 Selection of cables 
 The current carrying capacity ofa particular area of cross- 
section cable depends upon the following factors. 
*   Type of conductors (metal) 
*   Type ofinsulation 
*   Cable run in conduit or in open surface 
*   Single or three phase circuit 
*   Type of protection - coarse or close excess current

Classification of voltage grading 
Voltage is classified as 
1   Low voltage (L.V): Normally not exceeding 250V (i.e) 
from 0 to 250 volts. 
2   Medium voltage (M.V): Exceeding 250V but not ex- 
ceeding 650V from 250 to 650 volts 
3   Highvoltage (H. V)}: Exceeding 650V but not exceeding 
 33000V. (650-33000 volts) 
 4   Extra high voltage: All voltages above 33000V comes 
under this category.
