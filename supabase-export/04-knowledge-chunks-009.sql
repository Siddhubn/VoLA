 Voltage operated ELCBs are meant to be used where it is 
not practicable to meet the requirements of IEE   wiring

Construction of current operated ELCB 
It consists of a Torroid ring made of high permeability 
magnetic material.   It has two primary windings each 
carrying the current flowing through phase and neutral of 
the installation. The secondary winding is connectedtoa 
highly sensitive electro - magnetictrip relay which operates 
the trip mechanism. 
Working principle 
The residual current device (RCD) is acircuit breaker which 
continuously compares the current inthe phase with that 
inthe neutral. The difference between the twois called as 
the residual current which is flowing to earth. 
The purpose of the residual current device is to monitorthe 
residual current and to switch off the circuit if it rises from 
a preset level (Fig 2&3).

 Current operated ELCB 
 This device is used for making and breaking a circuit and   SERIE 
 for breaking a circuit automatically when the vector sumof   RELAY 
current in all conductors differs from zero by a precieter-   col. 
mined amount. Current operated ELCBs are much more 
reliable in operation, easier to install and maintain.

Purpose of fuses: Afuse isa safety device used for the 
purpose of protectinga   circuitagainst excess current. Inthe 
event of excessive current, the fuse element melts and 
opens up the circuit thereby protecting it from damage. 
Symbols:   These   are   the   graphical   symbols   used   to 
illustrate an electrical fuse in electro-technical diagrams.

Rewirable type fuse (Fig3): The fuse elementinthis type 
of fuse consists of a wire which may be replaced when 
necessary. These fuses are simple inconstructionandthe 
initial cost as Well as the renewal cost is very low.

Cartridge fuses: Cartridge fuses are developed to over- 
come the disadvantages ofthe rewirablefuses. As cartridge 
fuse   elements   are   enclosed   in   an   air tight   chamber, 
deterioration does not take place. Further the rating of a 
cartridge fuse couldbe accurately determinedtfrom its marking. 
However, the cost of replacement of cartridge fuses is more 
than that of rewirable fuses.

 Ferrule-contact cartridge fuses: This type,   is used for 
protecting electrical and electronic circuits. These are 
available in 25, 50, 100, 200, 250, 500 milliamperes, and 
also in 1,2,5,6,10,16 & 32 amperes capacity. 
Normally the current rating is written on one side ofthe cap, 
and while replacing, the same capacity fuse should be 
used.   Its body   is   made of glass and the fuse wire   is 
connected between two   metallic caps. 
This fuse can be plugged into the fuse socket (Fig 4a) or it 
canbe fitted into a fuse base witn a screw, type fuse- holder 
 (Fig 4b). 
 High rupturing capacity (HRC) fuses (Fig 5): They are 
cylindrical inshape and are made of aceramic body filled 
in with   a   chemically treated filling   powder or silica to 
quench the arcing quickly without any fire hazard. 
Normally a silver alloy is used as the fusing element and 
when it melts due to the excessive current, it combines 
with the surrounded sand/powder, and forms small glob- 
ules without making an are, spark or gas. HRC fuses can 
opena   short-circuited circuit withinO.013 second. Ithasan 
indicator to show the fuse has blown. 
AS HRC fuses are capable of opening circuits having very 
high faulty currents, these are preferred in high power 
circuits even though the replacement cost is high.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   define a relay and classify the relays 
*   classify relays according to the operating force and function 
*   state the causes of the failure of the relay. 
Relay: A relay is a device which opens or closes an 
auxiliary circuit under predetermined conditions in the 
 main circuit. 
 Relays   are   extensively   used   in   electronics,   electrical 
engineering and many other fields. 
There are relays that are sensitive to conditions of voltage, 
current, temperature, frequency or some combination of 
 these conditions. 
 Relays are also classified accordingtotheir main operating 
force as stated under. 
*   Electromagnetic relays 
«   Thermal relays 
Electromagnetic relay: A relay switch assembly is a 
combination of movable and fixed low-resistance contacts 
thatopenorclosea circuit. The fixedcontacts are mounted 
on springs or brackets, which have some flexibility. The 
movable contacts are mounted ona spring or   ahingedarm 
that is moved by the electromagnet in the relay (Fig 1).

 Currentsensing relay: A current sensing relay functions 
whenever the current inthe coilreaches an upper limit. The 
difference between the current specified for pick up (must 
operate) and non-pick up (must not operate) is usually 
closely controlled. The difference in current may also be 
closely controlledfor dropout   (must release) andnon-drop 
out (must not release). 
Under-current relay: Under-current relay is an alarm or 
protective relay. Itis specifically designedto operate when 
the current falls below a predeterminedvalue. 
Voltage sensing relay: A voltage sensing relay is used 
where a condition of under-voltage or over-voltage may 
cause a damage to the equipment. For example, these 
types of relays are used in voltage stabilizers.   Either a 
proportional AC voltage derived from a transformer or a 
proportional DC derived from a transformer and rectifier 
used for this purpose. 
Thermal relay: A thermal relay (Fig 2} is one thatoperates 
by changes in temperature. Most of the bimetallic relays 
where   the bimetallic element changes its shape, inresponse 
to changes in temperature comes under this group. 
Ittakes time for the heating elementto reach the necessary 
temperature and mere time to raise the temperature of the 
bimetallic element. Therefore, thermal relays are often 
used as time-delay relays.

 Causes of   relay failures:   Relay failures are   usually 
 caused by the gradual deterioration of the parts. This 
 deterioration can be electrical, mechanical or chemical in 
nature. 
 The   environmental   shirks that   contribute   to   physical 
 breakdown include large temperature changes, shock, 
 vibration and voltage or current changes. Therefore, it is 
 important thatthese factors are taken into consideration to 
ensure reliable performance of relays. 
In general, when a relay fails, look for the following. 
1   Improper control voltage. 
2   Dirt, grease or gum on contacts or moving parts. 
3   Excessive heating of parts: discolouration or charred 
insulation on coil or base. 
Bending of moving parts. 
Corrosion or deposits on metal parts. 
Excessive wear on moving parts.

 Introduction 
 The type of wiring to be adopted is dependent on various 
factors viz. location durability, safety, appearance, cost 
and consumer''s budget etc. 
Types of wiring 
The following   are the types of internal wiring   used   in 
domestic installations. 
*   Cleat wiring (fortemporary wiring only) 
*   CTS/TRS (batten) wiring 
*   Metal/PVC conduitwiring, either onsurface orconcealed 
in the wall. 
+   PVC casing & capping wiring 
Cleat wiring 
 Thissystem uses insulated cables supported in porcelain 
 cleats (Fig 1). 
Cleat   wiring   is   recommended   only   for   temporary 
 installations. These cleats are made in pairs having battam 
andtop halves (Fig 2). Bottomhalfis grooved to receive the 
 wire and the top half is for cable grip. 
 Initially the bottom and top cleats are fixed on the wall 
 loosely according to the layout. Then the cable is drawn 
 through the cleat grooves, and itis tensioned by pulling 
 and the cleats are tightened by the screw. 
The cleats are of three types,   having one, two or three 
grooves, so as to receive one, two or three wires.

 Types of Power wiring 
 Cleat wiring is one of the cheapest wirings considering the 
initial cost and labour, and is most suitable for temporary 
wiring. This wiring can be quickly installed, easily inspected 
and   altered.   When   not   required   this wiring   could   be 
dismantled without damage to the cables,   cleats and 
 accessories.   This type of wiring may be done by semi- 
 skilled persons. 
Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the types of electrical wiring and their application 
*   state the advantages and disadvantages of each types. 
Many wiring systems are developed to meet the safety 
requirements, economy of cost, easy maintenance and 
trouble shooting.   A particular system can   be chosen 
according te technical requirements butthe systemneeds 
to be approved by the local electricity authorities.   The 
following are the fundamental requirements for any wiring 
system.   They are: 
i   Forsafety, switches should control the live phase wire. 
The second terminal of the switch called as half wire 
shouldbe connected to the appliance or socket through 
the wire.   The neutral can be connected directly to the 
appliance, socket or lamp. 
ii   Forsafety, fuses should be placed inthe live/phasewire 
only. 
iii   Tosupply the rated voltage, parallel connections should 
be given to all lamps and appliances. 
Types of wiring system: There are three types ofwiring 
systems used fortapping supply from mainsto the different 
branches. They are as follows. 
|   Tree system 
2   Ring main system 
3   Distribution board system 
Tree system:   In this system, copper or aluminium strips 
inthe formof bus bars are usedto connectthe mainsupply 
to the raising mains (Fig1).   This system is suitable for 
multi-story buildings and the bus bar trunking space is 
provided inthe building at aconvenient locationand atload 
centres for the purpose of economy.

the flat get their supply fromthe sub-main boardthrougha 
distribution network which may include an energy meterfor 
each flat. 
However the system adopted within the flat will be the 
distribution board system. 
Advantages 
1   The length of the cables required for installation will 
become less.   Hence, the cost is less. 
2   This system is suitable for high rise buildings. 
Disadvantages 
1   The voltage across the appliances which are at the 
farthest end of the tree system   may be   less when 
 comparedito the one connectedto the nearest end ifthe 
 bus bars size is not of sufficient size. 
2   As fuses are located at different places, fault location 
becomes   troublesome. 
Tappings are taken for sockets or ceiling roses from the 
pair of cables through fuses and controlling switches. 
There may be saving of copper used because the current 
can be fed from both   sides.   As this system requires 
special sockets or plugs with fuses it becomes costly; and 
hence rarely used in India.

 As each circuit can have power up to 800 watt, the phase 
wire which is taken from the circuit fuse of the distribution 
board is looped to the other light switches or fanswitches 
of the same circuit by any one of the following ways. 
No joint is allowed in the cable route except in 
switches, ceiling roses and joint boxes. 
a   Looping out from switch and ceiling rose:   Fig5 
shows the simple looping in method which is commonly 
employed.   The phase wire which is connected to the 
terminals of the switch is looped out to the next switch 
and   so   on,   whereas the   neutral wires   are   looped 
together fromceiling roses (Fig 5). Cable consumedin 
this system is very high.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the layout, installation plan, circuit -diagram, wiring diagram and state their uses 
*   State the B.I.S. regulation pertaining to wiring installation. 
In electrical wiring work, the electrician is supplied with a 
layoutof wiring installation and aninstallation planinitially. 
On the   basis   of the   layout   and   installation   plan,   the 
electrician should draw the circuit and wiring diagrams 
beforethe commencement of   workfor systematicexecution 
of the work. 
The terms used inwiring installation drawings are explained 
 here. 
 Layoutdiagram: Some customers give their requirements 
in writing. But a few can give them in the form of a layout 
diagram to the electrician. 
The layout diagram (Fig 1) is a simplified version of the 
wiring diagram. Its purpose is to inform the reader quickly 
and exactly, what the circuitis designed for without giving 
any information on the circuit itself.

 Thistype of layout diagramis used for preparing architectural 
 diagrams, plans, etc. of a building. 
 In   a   layout   diagram,   it   is   necessary   to   indicate   with 
symbols   details like whether   the wiring isonthe surface or 
concealed, andthe run “up or down’, the number of wires 
inrun, dimensions, and accessories with appropriate |.S. 
symbols. 
Installation plan (Fig 2): This plan shows the physical 
position of accessoriesin an installation, andalso givesthe 
final appearance of   the installation. 
Circuit   diagram   (Fig   3):   This   shows the   schematic 
connections of the circuit for aspecific task inthe simplest 
form, incorporating the graphical symbols. 
The purpose ofa circuit diagram is to explain the function 
ofthe various accessoriesinthe circuit. Fiq3isanexample

 Forhisown good and to facilitate quicklocation of faults at 
a later stage, the   customer shouldinsist onthe electrician

 Selection of the type and   size of cable for a given wiring   installation   and 
voltage drop concept 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you will be able to 
*   state the factors to be considered for selecting the   cable   for a circuit 
*   apply the factors and select the cable. 
Inorder to determine the type and   size   of the cable for 
agiven circuit, the following points should be taken into 
account. 
*   Suitability of the type of cable   for the location of the 
circuit and the type of wiring. 
*   Sizeofthecable depending upon the currentcarrying 
capacity of the cable. 
*   Size of the cable depending   uponthe   length of the 
wiring and   permissible voltage drop in the cable. 
«   Minimum size of the   cable based on the economy. 
Location   of the circuit and the type of wiring 
decide the   type of cable. 
It is necessary to   consider whether the installation is for 
industry   or domestic use andwhether the atmosphere is 
damp or corrosive. Accordingly the type of cable has to 
be chosen. 
Further the type of wiring determines the type of cable 
suitable for the   installations. 
The   current carrying   capacity of   the cable 
decides the   size of the cable. 
In this, the first step is te find   out the current expected 
to flow inthe circuit   when the total connected load is fully 
switched   on. This   current   is the maximum current that 
would flow through   the   circuit   in case all the loads are 
working at the same time. But   this   is not the   case   in 
actual situations. 
Diversity factor 
Inthe   case of lighting   installation all the   lamps in   a 
domestic   installation may   not be   switched ‘on’ at   the 
same time. Hence, it is assumed only two   thirds of the 
lights   (say 66%)   only willbe ‘on’   at agiven   time. This 
introduces   afactor   called   ‘diversity factor’. 
When the   connectedload   is multiplied by the diversity 
factor you get a load value which can be said as normal 
working   load.   Use   ofthis   diversity factor   enables the 
technician to use a   lesser size   cable   than   the   one 
calculated,   based   on   the connected   load. 
Based onthe working load the current   in each circuit is 
to be calculatedand the size of the cable suitable to carry 
the current   has to be chosen. 
Voltage drop in the cable 
In any currentcarrying   conductor,   voltage drop takes 
place due to itsinternal   resistance.   This voltage drop 
inapremises as per BIS 732 should not be more than3 
percent of the standard supply voltage when measured 
between the consumer   supply point and any   point of 
the installation   when   the conductors   are   carrying 
the maximum   current   under   the normal conditions of 
service. 
Tables 3and4 for aluminiumcable and5 for copper cable 
give the relation   betweenvoltage dropandlength of the 
cable runfor various cables. Incase the voltage drop found 
in   the cable   exceeds   the stipulated limit of 3%   voltage 
drop, the technician has tochoose the next bigger sized 
cable   to maintain the voltage drop within limits. 
Ifthe cable size is increasedto avoid voltage drop in the 
circuit, the rating of the cable shall be the currentwhich 
the circuit is   designed to   carry. In each   circuit   or sub- 
circuit the fuse shall be selected to   match the load orthe 
cable rating whichever is minimum, to ensure the desired 
protection (BIS 732). 
Declared   voltage of supply to consumer 
Onthe other hand according to IE Rule No.54, the voltage 
atthe pointof commencement ofsupply atthe consumer 
should not vary from the   declared voltage by more than 
5 percentin thecase oflow or medium voltage or by more 
than   12 percent inthe case of high or extra high voltage

 flows through a conductor, the resistance offered by the 
 conductor produces   heat.   The increase   in   heat   is 
proportional   to   the   cable resistance   which   in   turn 
 depends   upon   the   cross-sectional area of the cable. 
 Since overheating damages the insulation, the conductor 
size must be adequate to   preventthis from occurring. 
 While choosing   the   cable   size, voltage drop is a more 
 severe limitation   than   any   othercriterion.   Hence,   it 
 is advisable   to   select the   cable   size   only   after 
ascertaining the   permissible voltage   drop. Excessive 
 voltage drop   impairs the   performance   of   heating 
 appliances,   lights   and   the electric motors. 
Calculation of voltage drop 
In DC and single phase AC two-wire circuits 
Voltage drop = Current x Total resistance of cables 
= 2IR

 Ris the resistance of one conductor only 
Wherever voltage dropis givenas 1 volt drop per metre run 
of cable,   we have to assume that both (lead and return) 
cables are taken   into   account   and   the cable   carries 
its   rated current.   In such cases   the voltage drop for X

 The above points could be explained through the following 
set of examples.

Current demand   in amperes in each of the circuit is 
 calculated by referring the Table 1. Calculate   current 
taking account into the   diversity factor.

 of the longest run ina   circuit as 50 metres

in 7.2 Volts 
 If   the size of the conductor   selected is   35.0 
sq.mm which can   carry 69 amps, the voltage 
 drop at 69 amperes   rating will be 1 volt for 
 every 7.2 metres cable run. 
For   50   metres cable   run   the voltage crop at 69 amps 
current rating = 50 / 7.2 volts.

 As   the actual voltage drop   inthe   circuit,   that   is   6.54 
valts,   is well within   the permissible value, of 7.2 volts, 
the cable   selected   is suitable for the installation.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the methods of cutting a metal conduit pipe 
*   state the purpose and process of threading   and list out the precautions of conduit pipes 
*   list the different accessories used in conduit installation 
*   state the purpose and methods of bending the conduit pipes and list out the precautions. 
Cutting: Rigidand intermediate conduits may be cut witha 
hacksaw (Fig 1) ora pipe cutter (Fig 2). With either method, 
the conduit must be locked ina pipe vice before   making the 
cut. 
After cutting (Figs 1 and 2) the inside edge of the conduit 
must be smoothed with a half round file   (Fig 3) or a pipe 
reamer mounted ina brace.

 Threading: Conduit is threaded by using dies and a die 
stock. Apply cutting cil to the end of the conduit before 
starting to cut threads. Cutting the threads longer than 
necessary will   leave the   exposed threads   subject   to 
corresion. 
De not use any lubricant which is an electrical insulator, 
as   this   may   increase   the   resistance   of the   conduit 
assembly and   affect   its   use   as the   circuit   protective 
earthing conductor. 
Precautions to be observed while threading conduit 
pipes 
1   Chamfer the end of the conduit to be threaded. 
2   Applyalubricantfrequently while threading the conduit 
pipe. It helps the die to cut more easily and the clie to 
stay sharp. 
3   Reverse turnings of the die stock are necessary to 
break off cut chips and to clearthe cutting edges of the 
die. 
4   Useonlyabrushto remove the metal burrsfromthedie. 
De not use your hand. 
Conduitfittings like elbows, bends and Tees: Allthese 
fittings are available in two categories. 
*   Normal 
*   Inspectiontype 
They are made from cast iron. 
Elbows are suitable for short bends whereas bends are 
suitable for long bends. In general where a conduit runs 
betweenthewallandthe ceiling, elbows are used. (Fig4a,b 
 & d) 
 Tees are used in switch-drops and diversions. Various 
types of these accessories (Fig 4c).

 Conduit saddles are used to fasten the conduit on the 
surface of the walls. These saddles could be used along 
with any one ofthe following bases. They are: 
*   spacers made from sheet metal 
*   distance piece made from wood or PVC 
*   hospital piece made from wood or PVC.

 Metal conduit boxes: Termination of rigid conduits is 
done at metal conduit boxes of either cast iron or sheet 
metal. Various shapes and sizes of boxes are commer- 
cially available in the market. Junction boxes of round, 
square, rectangular and hexagonal shapes are manufac- 
tured for one-way, 2-way, 3-way and 4-way outlets. 
These outlets may be straight, angular or tangential as 
required for the situation. VWvhen ordering, the specification 
should contain the material with which the box is to be 
made, the size of the conduit to be fitted, the number of 
ways, shape and the position of outlets. (Fig 6)

 Conduit pipe bending: It is often necessary to set or 
bend the conduit to enable it to pass over an obstruction 
(Fig /)ortoturna   corner which is less or more than 90° 
(Fig 8). The bending may be   a   little offset to the line of 
conduit installation. This can be manipulated by proper 
bending as required. 
The bending may be done by using a simple bending block 
or by a hickey or with the help of   a bending machine. 
Further, inconcealedconduitwiring, the B.I.S. recommends 
bending of conduit pipesin preference to the use of bends 
and elbows. 
Using bending block for bending conduit: The bending 
block (Fig 9) is made preferably with teak wood or strong 
country wood,   and should   have   holes suitable for the 
conduitto be bent. Edges are chamferred to avoid kinks in 
the bent portion of the conduit. Light gauge conduits need 
to be filled with sand and heated before bending to have 
smooth bends.

 Using hickeyfor bending conduits: A hickey isa special 
bending tool (Fig   10) and is made of forged steel or alloy 
steel. A particular size of pipe requires that size of hickey. 
Bending of pipes could be performed cold or hot by using 
a hickey. 
Using bending machine for bending conduit: Various 
types of bending machines are available inthe market. They 
can either be operated by hand (Fig 11) or by hydraulic 
pressure. Foreachsize ofconduit, the guide and collet need 
to be changed. 
Precautions to be observed while bending

 BENDING CONDUIT WITH THE BENDING MACHINE  ELN227150, 
 Poorly seam-welded pipes are not suitable for bending 
as they may split while bending. 
One of the easy methods of bending is to draw the 
bending curve on the floor and bend the pipe accord- 
ingly. 
Whena wooden blockis usedfor bending, chamfer both 
sides of the hole opening in the block. 
Ensure that the conduit does not twist while bending. 
Use a proper size of hickey according to the dia. of the 
pipe to be bent. 
While doing manual hot bending do not use wet sandas

 Test   board,   Extension   board   and   colour code of cables 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   explain the method of using a test board 
*   state the general colour codes used in cables. 
Test board: Atest boardis an electric switch board, used 
for conducting the following tests. 
*   Continuitytest (Load connectedinseries witha lamp) 
Example: Testing of fan winding, condition of choke 
and tube light   starter etc. 
 ¢   Directtest 
 Example : Testing electrical appliances of 1000 watts 
orlower rating for properfunctioning. 
Fig 1 source the schematic diagram of atest board with 
all the outlets and controls. Sockets P, and P,   provide 
direct, single-phase supply whereas socket P,, andterminal 
block T provide a single-phase supply in series with the 
lamp L,.

 SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM   Es 
 Continuity test: VVhileé performing a continuity test, the 
 appliance to be tested is connected to the socket P, or tothe 
 terminal T which are in series with the lamp L, and are 
controlled by switch S,.   Normally thistest is conducted bythe 
electrician   to   ascertain whether the   appliance   is open- 
circuited or short-circuited. A low wattage, appliance when 
connected, will make the lamp L, to burn dim, and a high 
wattage appliance will make the lamp to bum bright. 
According to the brightness ofthe lamp, the behaviour ofthe 
appliance, as well as the wattage of the appliance and the 
lampandthe condition ofthe appliance could be judged. “No 
light indicates either open circuit or high resistance in the 
appliance. Inthe same way, achokecoil and astarter ofatube 
light can be checked. (The flickering of the lamp L, with the 
starter indicates that the starter is good.) 
Thus the testing board also works as a continuity tester. 
Direct testing: By connecting the appliance direct to the 
socket P, or P.,, the performance of the appliance can be 
verified after repair. 
 156 
 Fuses: lfthe indicator lampL, does not burn, itindicates no 
supply.   On the other hand,   in normal conditions,   the 
indicator lamp L, will not burn, and it burns only when the 
fuse F, is open. 
Thus the test board is a cheap and handy test set whichis 
easy to use by anelectricianto carry out his routine checks 
in the course of his work. 
Colour identification of cables: The colour ofthe cables 
indicates theirfunction. Table 1 gives the colour code and 
the alpha-numericnotationas recommended by N.E.Code. 
The rules apply for marking conductors in equipment? 
apparatus/installation.

Extension board (Fig 2) 
Extension boards are used to operate portable electrical 
appliances/ machines. Itis also used where more number 
of sockets are required at a time. 
Extension boards are available in different shapes with

 Conduit wiring - types of conduits - non-metallic conduits (PVC) 
 Objectives: At the end ofthis lesson you shall be able to 
¢ distinguish between the different types of conduits used in wiring 
¢ State the different types of accessories used in non-metallic conduits wiring. 
Ingeneral, conduit is defined as a tube or channel, which 
is the   most commonly used   in electrical   installations. 
Whencables are drawn through the conduit andterminated 
at the outlet or switch points, the system ofwiring is called 
conduit wiring. 
Types of conduits 
There are four types of conduits used for wiring. 
*   Rigid steel conduits 
*   Rigid non-metallic conduits 
*   Flexible conduits 
«   Flexible non-metallic conduits. 
Non-metallic conduits 
These are made of fibres,   asbestos, polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC), high density polyethylene (HDP) or poly vinyl (PV). 
Ofthe above, PVC conduits are popular owingto   their high 
resistance to moisture and chemical atmosphere,   high 
dielectric strength, low weight and low cost. These conduits 
may be buried in lime, concrete or plaster without harmful 
effects. 
However, light gauge (lower than 1.5 mm wall thickness) 
PVC pipes are not as strong as metal conduits against 
mechanical impact. Special PVC pipes which are heavy 
gauge and high impact resistance are available in the 
market which can withstand heavy mechanical impact as 
the thickness of the pipe   is more than 2 mm. 
There are some PVC heavy gauge conduits having special 
base material madeto withstand temperatures upto 85°C. 
These PVC conduits are available in 3 m length. 
Variation in conduit wiring systems 
There are two types of conduit wiring systems as stated 
below, for either metallic or non-metallic types. 
*   Surface conduit wiring system done on wall surfaces. 
*   Concealed   (recessed) conduit wiring   system done 
inside the concrete, plaster or wall. 
Selection of the type of conduit 
Metallic or PVC conduits are equally popular in electrical 
installations. Selectionofthe type of conduit depends upon 
the following criteria. 
*   Type oflocation, outdoor or indoor 
*   Type of atmosphere,   dry or damp or   explosive or 
corrosive 
*   Expected workingtemperature 
*   Exposureto physical damage dueto mechanical impact 
*   Allowable weight of conduit runs 
*   Estimated cost. 
Special precautions with non- metallic conduits 
1   Ifthe conduits are liable to mechanical damages they 
should be adequately protected. 
2   Non-metallicconduits shall not be used forthe following 
applications. 
3   In   concealed/inaccessible   places   of   combustible 
constructionwhere the ambient temperature exceeds 
 60°C.

 Method of cutting, joining and bending PVC conduit 
pipes 
While doing the conduit wiring, it becomes essential, that 
the length has to be increased or decreased. Further the 
conduit is to be bent according to the required situation. 
Cutting PVC conduit 
APVC conduit is easily cut by holding at the corner of a 
bench and using a hacksaw. Any roughness of cut and 
burrs should be removed with the aid ofa knife blade/emery 
sheet, or sometimes by using a reamer. Before installing 
the PVC conduit pipe great care shouldbe takento remove

The most common   jointing procedure uses a PVC solvent 
adhesive. Before applyingthe adhesive the inner surface of 
the accessory and the outer surface of the PVC pipe shall 
be cleaned with emery sheet to have a better grip. The 
adhesive should be applied to the receiving portion of the 
conduit fitting, and the conduit twisted into it to ensure a 
total coverage. 
Generally,   the joint   is solid   enough for use after two 
minutes although complete adhesion takes several hours. 
Inorder to ensure a sound joint, the tube and fittings must 
be clean and free from dust and oil. 
Where   expansion   is   likely   and   adjustments   become 
necessary a mastic adhesive should be used. This is a 
flexible adhesive which makes a weatherproof joint, ideal 
for surface installations and in conditions of wide temperature 
variation. It is also advisable to use the mastic adhesive 
where there are straight runs on the surface exceeding & 
metres in length.

Then bend the required angle is made by holding both 
sides, with sufficient gap from the heated portion to avoid 
burning of hands, andapplying uniform pressure (Fig 8b). 
Care shall be taken to avoid kinks on the conduits while 
 bending. 
 Conduit fittings should be best avoided, as far 
as possible, on outdoor systems. 
 Bends in conduit 
 All bends inthe non-metallicsystem shall be formed either 
by bending the pipes by proper heating or by inserting 
suitable accessories such as bends elbows or similar 
fittings.   Solid type fittings   shall   be   used for recessed 
wiring.   Solid type/inspection type of fittings shall be used 
for surface conduit wiring. 
The minimum bending radius of conduits shall be 7.5 cm. 
Care should be taken while bending the pipes to ensure 
that conduit pipes are not damaged or cracked and the 
internal diameter is not effectively reduced. 
Inrecessed conduit wiring, conduit bending, otherthanat 
the ends,   shall   be made   by bending the pipes to the 
required angle and clamping at short intervals. Inthe case 
of conduits laid in the roof slab, it can be clamped or tied 
to steel reinforcement bars with suitable metallic clamps. 
Inthe case of conduits recessed onwalls, the chasis shall 
be made in the required shape and conduit fixed in the 
groove with suitable clamps.   In the case of bending for 
surface conduit system, bending can be done either at 
cold state or by proper heating. 
Bending PVC conduit in cold weather (Fig 7) 
In cold weather it may become necessary to warm the 
conduit slightly at the point where the bend is required. 
One of the simplest ways to do this is to rub the conduit 
with the hand or a cloth. The PVC will retain the heat 
created long enough forthe bend to be mace. Inorderthat 
the bend is maintained at the correct angle, the conduit 
should be saddled as quickly as possible. 
Bending of conduit by heating 
The piece of conduit to be bent is first cut and inspected 
for any sharp edges or burrs left out. Insuch cases it shall 
be made smooth   by using suitable emery sheet. The 
conduit is then filled with riversand. The ends are sealed

 In PVC conduit wiring the first step is to select the correct 
size of conduit. The conduit size is determined by the 
size of cables and the number of cables to be drawnina 
particular section. This information can be obtained from 
the wiring layout and the wiring diagram. 
 Selection of conduit size 
 Anon-metallic conduit pipe, used in wiring, should have a 
minimum size of 20 mm in diameter. Where a large number 
of conductors are to be drawn, the size of the diameter 
depends on the size of the conductor and the number of 
conductors. Table 1 gives details of the numbers and the 
sizes of conductors that can be drawn in each size of a 
non-metallic conduit. 
When 2.5 sq mm 650 V grade single core cables of six 
numbers are to be drawn in a single run, we can use 25 
mm non-metallic conduit as per the table. 
When 6 sq mm.   650 V single core 6 cables are to be 
drawnina single pipe we can use 32 mm PVC pipe. The 
following are the maximum permissible number of 650/

 PVC Channel (casing and capping) wiring 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state the use limitation and rules of channel wiring system 
*   select the channel size according to size and number of cables from the chart 
*   explain the method of fabricating neutral, bend, and junction in PVC channel . 
Introduction : Channel (Casing and Capping) wiring is a 
system of wiring   in which   PVC/metallic channels with 
 covers are used for drawing wires. Thissystem of wiringis 
 suitable for indoor surface wiring works.   This system is 
adopted to give a good appearance and for extension of 
existing wiring   installation.   PVC insulated cables are 
generally used for wiring in casing and capping system. 
This is otherwise called ‘wireways’. 
The channel and top cover shall be of the same material 
either PVC or anodised aluminium. The casing is square 
orrectangularin shape. The capping shall be slide intype 
with double grooving inthe case of PVC wire ways.   Plain 
type capping are used for metallic wireways. 
The only disadvantage in a channel wiring is that it is 
inflammable and risk offire. 
Dimensions: The sizes of channel, the maximum number 
of wires which can be drawn in each size are giveninthe 
table 1 below. 
 The thickness of channel should be 1.2mm +0.1mm.

 Precautions 
 1   Neutral   (Negative) cables should   be   carried in top 
channel and phase (Positive) in the bottom channel. 
2   Crossingofcables between phase (Positive) and neutral 
(Negative) should be avoided. 
3   PorcelainorPVC pipe should be used for crossing the 
cables through the walls. 
Installation of PVC channel : The channel should be 
fixed to wall/ceiling with flatheaded screws andrawl plugs. 
These screws shall be fixed at an interval of 60cm.   On 
either side of joints this distance shall not exceed 15cm 
fromthe end point. Channel under steel joints shall be fixed 
with MS clips of not less than 1.2mm (18SW6G} thickness 
and width not less than 19mm. 
Floor/Wall crossings : VWnen conductor pass through 
floorsAvall the same should be carried in a steel conduit/ 
PVC conduits properly bushed at both ends. The conduits 
shall be carried 20cm above floor level and 2.5cm below 
ceiling level and properly terminated into the channel. 
Joints   in   PVC/Metal   channel   :   As   far   as   possible 
wireways in straight runs shouldbe single piece. Alljoints 
shall be scarfed or cut diagonally in longitudinal section. 
The section ends shall be filed smoothly but joined without 
any gap. Care shall be taken to see that the joints in PVC 
 cover does not overlap those channel. 
 Joints shall also be done using standard accessories like 
elbows, tees, 3 ways/4 ways   junction box etc of high grade 
P¥C/Aluminium alloy.   InPVC channel separate channel 
cover for joint, elbows, tees, crossetcare available. These 
can   be fixed   after fixing   the   channel to   give   a   good 
appearance. The radius of curvature of the cables insidea 
bend should be more than 6 times its over all diameter. 
Inthe case of PVC channel,   making joints is comparatively 
easy. Mark the joints by placing the two pieces inrequired 
angle.   Identify the position to be cut and remove on each 
pieces.   Cut through the lines and file the edges to get 
gapless joint. 
Fabricating a right-angled vertical bend 
1   Mark out the position of bend of all sides as shown in 
Fig 1. the width "Y’ must be made equal to the diagonal 
length “Y’ to be cut. 
2   Drill small holes in corners at point of bend to stop 
channel folding (Fig 1).

A panel wiring diagram usually gives information about the 
relative position and arrangement   of devices and termi- 
nals of the devices to help in installing or servicing the 
device. 
Generally all the control panel / commercial / industrial 
wiring invariably consists oftwo sections viz control wiring 
and power wiring. 
Fig 1 shows the typical layout diagram of a motor wiring. 
The control panel consisting of allthe controland protective 
devices installed near to the power source and the load 
like, furnace, compressor etc, are installed away fromthe 
power source / panel boards. 
Powerwiring isa high current carrying circuitwhichis wired 
to connect / disconnect the load   like   motors/ furnace 
through the protective devices like OLR and fuses etc..

 ELN227241 
 Power wiring has to be done as per the guideline andrules 
specified in IE rules. The cable size depends on the load 
current and it varies according to the load. 
The power and control cable should not be run into single 
conduit.   As the current radiation influences the control 
cable,   a seperate conduit to be provided for control and 
power cables. 
Control wiring 
Control wiring is a circuit which is wired to communicate 
the commands and other information between control 
devices and lighting. 
Control wiring enables the control circuitforvarious control 
purpose. Ina motor control unit the control circuitis wired 
andkept nearto motor. In othersystem such asfire alarm, 
fire detector etc. The control circuitis wired seperately with 
low current carrying condutors and drawn seperately for 
easy maintenance. 
 Fire   alarm 
 The purpose of fire alarmsystemisto provide animmediate 
alarm incase of any fire andto prevent loss of life, also to 
secure the immediate attention of fire fighting staff. 
 Fire detectors 
 The three principal fire detection methed involve sensing 
the heat, presence of flame or smoke. The third method 
identifies the pre - fire condition that is a flammable gas 
detector, which istechniclaly not afire detector andits use

The three basic operating principles for heat detection are: 
a   Fusion detector (melting of a metal} 
b   Thermalexpansion detector 
c   Electrical sensing 
ll   Smoke detectors 
There are three types of smoke detectors namely 
1   lonisation detector 
2   Light - scattering smoke detector 
3   Obscuration smoke detector. 
Ill   Flammable gas detector 
A flammable gas detector is designed to measure the 
 amount of flammable gas in the atmosphere.   The gas 
 mixture is drawn over a catalytic surface where oxidation 
i.e. combustion takes place. The combustion causes a 
rise in temperature of the surface which is measured by a 
decrease inits electrical resistance. The instruments are 
calibrated by considering pentane or heptane as reference 
gas. The readings are displayed in terms of percentage of 
lower explosive limit. 
Control panel for fire alarm system 
The control panel is the heart ofthe systemthrough which 
the fire alarmsystem is monitored and alarmis   initiated if 
any indication/signal is conveyed to the panel. 
Theworking of thefire alarmsystemshould be 
checked once in a month regularly. 
The features of the control panel are the power supply, 
battery charging unit and control card. 
Communication wiring 
It is type of wiring which is used to transmit the voice, 
data, images and video etc to the desired places. 
Some of examples are 
*   Telephone wiring 
*   Internet   /LAN network wiring 
*   Cable TV and other entertainment wiring 
*   Data and security services wiring 
¢   Telex/ Fax machines wiring 
Faster and more reliable than ordinary phone wiring, low- 
cost, high-tech copper wiring should serve every room in 
the modern home. Its is required to carry voice, data and 
other services from where they enter the house to every 
room, and from any one room te any other. 
Necessity of communication wiring 
Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) copper information wiring 
often called structured wiring is used today for offices, 
schools and factories to   provide local   area   networks 
(LANs), which allow computers to talk to one another and 
to receive and send Internet and high-speed computer data 
outside the facility. 
Educated homebuyers-and homebuilders realize it is better 
to use the most advanced wiring technology upfront, when 
installation is economical. 
It''s better to anticipate the homeowner''s future needs by 
wiring the house with a state-of-the-art system while it is 
being built, and at the same time equip yourself with a 
powerful marketing tool. 
The phone wiring of the past, often referred to as quad 
wiring because it has four copper wires, is now obsolete. 
Cat5 or higher speed wiring has four twisted wire pairs, or 
eight wires. 
Copper UTP Wiring 
Copper UTP wiring contains eight color-coded conductors 
(four twisted   pairs of copper wires).   It offers greatly 
increased bandwidth compared with old-fashioned quad 
wiring. 
The   cable   is small   (roughly 3/16   inch   in   diameter}, 
inexpensive and easy to pull, although it must be handled 
 with care. 
 Advantages 
Modern copper UTP wiring offers the following advantages: 
Diversity 
The Internet and computer communications, as well as 
ordinary phone signals, can be carried throughout the home 
on modern,   inexpensive,   high-speed,   UTP cables.   (To 
service a large number of T¥ channels, it is recommended 
to also   run   high-quality coaxial cable,   such   as quad- 
 shielded RG-6. ) 
 More phone numbers 
Several phone numbers can be made available throughout 
the   house.   Actually,   voice   service requires very   little 
bandwidth, and the addition of separate numbers is almost 
trivial. 
Fig 1 isasimplified plan of a small, two-bedroom, single- 
story house. Note that all the wiring radiates froma   single 
distribution device the star pattern and there are multiple 
outlets in each major room, including the kitchen and the 
porch. 
Entertainment wiring 
Itis a type of wiring which is mainly used for entertainment 
or relaxation purpose.Example Home theatre wiring. 
The nature and quality of wiring will not only determine the 
level of safety in home theatre room, but equally important, 
will have a noticeable impact on the video and sound 
quality of your system components. 
Home   Theatre Wiring   Basics:   Safety,   planning, 
budgeting 
VWWhen it comes to home theatre wiring, the guiding principle 
 is... 
 *   Do it safe

Safety: This is a most important aspect in any installation. 
Do not save on the wiring by using sub-standard cables. 
With in-wall   installations,   Specially certified wires 
(UL-rated CL3 wires) should be used that comply with 
 national   standards for   resistance to fire,   chemicals, 
 abrasion, and temperature extremes. 
Planning: Planning is the key to future proofing the 
installation while avoiding costly  alterations later on. 
AV (Audio  Video) equipment and speaker placement the 
 room lighting requirements,  networking,  possible future 
additions, etc. are to be taken  care of these will determine 
 the quantity and placement of the  various audio/video points 
inthe room as well as the electrical needs for home theatre 
 installation. 
Finally, when it comes to estimating the required cable 
 lengths, do not just calculate the linear lengths to complete 
your cable runs: allow for at least 20% extra to cover for 
 possible errors and slack for terminations. 
 Home Theatre Speaker Wiring 
Many fail to  realize that home theatre  wiring can  have a 
 noticeable impact on speaker performance. The greatest 
 speakers will not sound their best with the use of 
inappropriate speaker wires or an incorrect  wiring 
installation. In particular, selecting  the correct speaker  wire 
thickness is essential for the best speaker performance. 
At  the same time, keep in mind that some speaker 
 manufacturers use  non-standard connectors with their 
speakers; in these  circumstances,  use of optional third- 
 part speaker wire and connectors may not always be  an 
option  unless you take the extreme route  of splice your 
 wiring. 
Speaker Wire Size 
 Selecting the correct thickness for your home theater wiring 
is important as it affects the speakers’ performance; it will

impact the speakers’ ability to deliver the explosive effecis 
in home theatre sound. 
Single Room Installation 
 The thicker wire will help bring out fine musical detail in 
quality music systems,  as well as deliver the  explosive 
 effects  of surround  sound. 
In those situations where long speaker wire runs cannot 
 be avoided, thicker wire helps reduce the overall resistance, 
 and therefore amplifier load - leading to lower  operating 
temperatures. This will result in improved sound quality 
and long-term stability. 
After setting up a modestly priced home-theatre-in-a-box 
package, do not go for the more expensive thicker wire 
 unless you plan an upgrade sometime in the future; using 
 of gauge 16 speaker wire should suffice in this case. 
 Connection Basics 
 Speakers and amplifiers/receivers normally come equipped 
with one of two types of connectors - spring terminals or 
binding post connectors. 
Each speaker connection have two such terminals marked 
(+) and (-) to help you distinguish the two leads. Maintaining 
correct polarity all along your home theater wiring is 
 important.   For this reason, speaker wire and terminals 
 are normally color coded black for the -ve terminal and red 
for +ve side. 
Spring  terminals will only accept pin connectors or tinned 
base wire  ends. Instead, binding  posts  accept many types 
of connection,  including pin, banana plug  or spade. 
Guidelines for Home theatre wiring & installation 
*   Donot run home theatre cables in close proximity or 
parallel to other electrical lines, nor run your wiring 
around power supplies as these can lead to interference

Special wiring circuits - Tunnel, corridor, godown and   hostel wiring 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
¢ state the difference between godown, tunnel and corridor, bank/hostel wirings 
¢ draw the tunnel lighting / corridor / bank / hostel circuits 
¢   prepare the mode chart for the above   circuits. 
Staircase wiring: In wiring one lamp controlled with one 
switchina simple wiring circuit to begin with. However,one 
lamp controlled withtwo switches from two   different places, 
known an staircase wiring in the very basic wiring. Fig 1 
shows such a wiring where two double pole switches are 
used to control one lamp individually.

 In the case of godown wiring we have seen that as you 
move inside the godown, youcan switch on alampahead 
of you while the light behind you Is put off. The same 
process inthe reverse order takes place while moving out 
ofthe godown. 
But one light willnot be sufficient to give enough illumination 
inthe case of tunnels where darkness is more. Hence, the 
wiring circuit for a tunnel neecs at least two   lights to be ‘ON’ 
at a time while a person moves inside a tunnel and goes 
out. 
Whereas inthe case of corridor wiring the corridor may 
have a number of rooms occupied by different persons. 
VWhenone moves toward his room, he needs a forward light 
to do so. The moment he finds the room and opens it, he 
may not need the corridor light. Then there should be an 
arrangement to switch off the light left behind the forward 
moving person and at the same time there should be a 
provision to switch off the lightin front of his room. Suchan 
arrangementis incorporated in corridor wiring. 
Tunnel lighting circuit (Fig 2) 
In tunnel wiring a person walking along the tunnel can 
successively light behind two lamps ahead and put off a 
lamp behind with one switch. 
All switches are two-way switches.

 Caution: This circuit is not in accordance with 
IE rules as the phase and neutral come   in the 
same switch. So care should be taken while 
connecting the wires.

In this circuit, operating the first switch in one set makes 
the first light to switch on while operating the 2nd switch in 
the first set switchesoff the first light. This sequence goes 
on as explained in the mode chart.

 Godown lighting circuit 
 Letus consider a gocown lighting circuit (Fig 4) having four 
 lamps L,,L,,L,andL, which are to be controlled such that 
if one moves ina godown in either direction he can switch 
ON one light afterthe other in the forward direction while the 
lamp which was lighted earlier gets switched OFF.   Inan 
arrangement. S, isa one way switch, S,,S,andS, aretwo- 
way switches. 
While coming back from the godown when the person 
switches off the   light 4, then the light 3 will be on and give 
light for his return movement. When he leaves the godown 
allthe lights could be switched ‘off by operating switch S,.

 Intermediate switch - Application in lighting circuit 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
¢   draw diagrams of a lighting circuit using intermediate switches. 
An intermediate switch is a special type of switch having 
four terminals for connection. This switch is commonly 
usedto control a lamp orload fromthree or more positions 
as encountered in the lighting of staircases,   corridors, 
 bedrooms. 
 The schematic diagram (Fig 1) is for controlling one lamp 
from five locations using two two-way switches and three 
intermediate switches is given below.

 Inthe schematic diagram (Fig 2) isfor controllingone lamp 
from3 positions with a master control as asecurity control 
switch. The lamp is controlled independently from three 
 places by switches S,,S,andS,. Whenthe master switch 
 ‘M’ is ‘ON’ the lamp is permanently ‘ON’and cannot be 
controlled by switches S,, S, and S.,,.

 Asintermediate switches are costly two numbers of two- 
way switches can be linked througha common bar and can

 Main   board with   MCB DB Switch and fuse box 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you will be able to 
*   state the | E regulations/   B |S   recommendations/ NE Code of practice with regard to the main board and 
 distribution fuse box. 
 Reception and distribution of main supply 
There shall be a circuit breaker ora linked switch with fuse 
in each live conductor of the supply mains at the point of 
entry. 
The neutral wire should not have any break inthe form of 
switchor fuse unit. Inthe main switch, the neutral conductor 
should be marked clearly. 
The mainswitchgear shall be located ina place where itis 
accessible and should be near to the terminating point of 
the service line. 
Main switches and switchboards 
 Reference BIS 732-1963 and NE code. 
 All main switches shall be either of metal-clad enclosed 
pattern or ofany insulated enclosed pattern which shall be 
fixed at close proximity to the point of entry of supply. 
 Location 
 Switchboards shall not be erected above gas stoves or 
sinks, or within 2.5 m of any washing unit in the washing 
rooms or laundries, orinbathrooms, lavatories, toilets, or 
kitchens. 
In   the case of switchboards unavoidably fixed in places 
likely to be exposed to atmospheric weather, the outer 
casing shall be weatherproof and shall be provided with 
glands or bushings oradapted to receive screwedconduit, 
according to the manner in which the cables are run. 
 Metal-clad switchgears shall preferably be mounted onany 
 of the following types of boards. 
Hinged type metal boards 
These shall consist of a box made of sheet metal not less 
than 2 mmthick and shall be provided with a hinged cover 
to enable the board to swing open for examination of the 
wiring at the back. 
The joints shall be welded. The board shall be securely 
fixed to the wall by means of rag bolts, plugs,   or wooden 
gutties and shall be provided with a locking arrangement 
and an earthing stud. All wires passing through the metal 
board shall be bushed. Alternatively, hinged type metal 
boards shall   be   made of sheet covering   mounted on 
channel or angle iron frames. 
Such types of boards are particularly suitable 
for small   switchboards for mounting   metal- 
clad switchgears connected to supply at low 
voltages. 
 168 
 Fixed type metal boards 
These shall consist ofanangle or channel iron frame fixed 
onthe wall or on the floor and supported onthe wall atthe 
top, if necessary. There shall be a clear distance of one 
metre in front of the switchboard. 
Such types of boards are particularly suitable 
for   large   switchboards   for   mounting   large 
number of switchgears or highercapacity metal- 
clad switchgear or both. 
 Teak wood boards 
 For small installations connected to a single phase 240 
volts supply, teak wood boards may be used as main 
boards or sub-boards. These shall be of seasoned teak or 
other durable wood with solid   back impregnated with 
varnish of approved quality with all joints dovetailed. 
Thoroughly protected both inside and outside with good 
insulating varnish conforming to 1S:347-1952 and of not 
less than6.5 mmthickness, shall be provided atthe back 
for attachment of incoming and outgoing cables. There 
shall be a clear distance of not less than 2.5 cm between 
the teak wood board and the cover, 
Recessing of boards 
Where so specified, the switchboards shall berecessedin 
the wall.   The front shall be fitted with a hinged panel of teak 
wood or other suitable materials, suchas Bakelite, orwith 
unbreakable glass doors inteak woodframeswith locking 
arrangement, the other surface of the doors beingflushwith 
the walls. Ample room shall be provided at the back for 
connection   and   at the   front   between   the   switchgear 
mountings. 
Arrangement of apparatus 
Equipment which   is on the front of a switchboard shall be 
so arranged that inadvertent personal contact with live 
parts   is   unlikely   during   the   manipulation of switches, 
changing of fuses or like operation. 
No apparatus shall project beyond any edge ofthe panel. 
No fuse body shall be mounted into 2.5 cmof any edge of 
the panel and no hole other than the holes by means of 
which the panel is fixed shall be drilled closer than 1.3 cm 
from any edge of the panel. 
Inevery case in which switches and fuses are fitted onthe

following colours to indicate the different poles or phases 
to which the apparatus or its different terminals may have 
beenconnected. 
Alternating current 
Three phases   -—red, yellow and   blue. 
 Neutral   — black. 
 Where three-phase, 4-wire wiring is done, the neutral shall 
be inone colourand the other three wires in another colour. 
Where a board has more than one switch,   each such 
switch shall be marked to indicate which section of the 
installation itcontrols. The main switch shall be markedas 
such and where there is more than one main switch inthe 
building, each such switch shall be marked to indicate 
which section of the installation it controls. 
 Main and branch distribution boards 
 The main and branch distribution boards shall be of any 
type mentioned here. 
The main distribution board shall be provided witha switch 
or circuit-breaker oneach pole of each circuit, afuse onthe 
phase or live conductor anda   link onthe neutral or earthed 
conductor of each circuit. The switches shall always be 
 linked. 
 Branch distribution boards shall be provided with a fuse on 
the live conductor of each circuit and the earthed neutral 
conductor shall be connected to a common link and be 
capable of being disconnected   individually for testing 
purposes. One spare circuit ofthe same capacity shall be 
provided oneach branch distribution board. Lights and fans 
 may be wired onacommon circuit. Such sub-circuit shall 
 not have more than a   total of ten points of lights, fans and 
socket outlets. The load of such circuit shall be restricted 
to 800 watts.   If   a separate fan circuit is adopted, the 
number of fans in the circuit shall not exceed ten. 
 Power sub-circuits 
 The outlet shall be provided accordingtothe load designfor 
these circuits but inno case shall there be more than two 
outlets oneach circuit. The load oneach power sub-circuit 
should be restricted to 3000 watts. 
 Installation of distribution boards 
 «   Thedistributionfuse-boards shall be located as near as 
possible to the centre of the load they are intended to 
control. 
¢   Distribution boards shall be fixed at a height not more 
than 2 metres from the floor level. 
*   These shall be fixed on suitable stanchion or wall and 
shall be accessible for replacement of fuses. 
*   These shall be of either metal-clad type orall-insulated 
type. But, if exposed to weather or damp situations, 
they shall be of   weatherproof type and,   if installed 
where exposed to explosive dust, vapour or gas, they 
shall be of flame proof type. 
«   Vvhere there are two or more distribution fuse-boards in 
feeding low voltage circuits and fed from a supply at 
medium voltage, these distribution boards shall be: 
-   fixed not less than 2 m apart; or 
-   arranged so that it is not possible to open two ata 
time, namely, they are interlocked and the metal 
case is marked ‘Danger 415   Volts’: or 
-   installed in a room or enclosure accessible to only 
authorized persons. 
*   Alldistribution boards shall be marked ‘Lighting’ or'' Power’ 
 asthe case may be andalso marked with the voltage and 
 number of phases of the supply. Each shall be provided 
witha circuitlist giving details ofeach circuitwith controls, 
the current rating and its size of fuse-element. 
Wiring of distribution boards 
In wiring branch distribution board, the total load of the 
consuming devices shall be divided, as far as possible 
evenly between branchcircuits. 
Cables shall be connected to a terminal only by soldered 
or welded or crimped lugs using suitable sleeve or lugs or 
ferrules unless the terminal is of such a form that it is 
possible to securely clamp them without cutting away 
cable strands. 
 Fuses 
 a   Afuse carrier shall not be fitted with a fuse element of 
higher rating than thatfor which the carrier is designed. 
b   Thecurrent rating of afuse shall not exceed the current 
rating of the smallest cable in the circuit protected by 
the fuse. 
c   Every fuse shall have inits own case or cover, orinan 
adjacent conspicuous position, an indelible indication 
of its appropriate currentrating forthe protection ofthe 
circuit which it controls. 
 Selection of size of conductor 
 The size of conductors ofcircuits shall be so selected that 
the drop in voltage from the consumer''s terminals in a 
public supply (orfromthe bus-bars of the main switchboard 
controlling the various circuits ina private generation plant) 
to any point onthe installation does not exceed 3 per cent 
of the voltage at the consumer''s terminals. 
In each circuit or sub-circuit the fuse shall be selected to 
match the cable rating to ensure the desired production. 
All conductors   shall   be   of copper or aluminium.   The 
conductorforfinal sub-circuit for fan and light wiring shall 
have a nominal cross-sectional area of not less than 1.00 
mim? copper and 1.50 mm? aluminium. The cross-sectional

 In earlier domestic installations the service mains were 
brought inside the consumer premises andfirst connected 
to the IC cutouts, then to the energy meter and   to the 
consumer main switch ( Fig 4a and 4b) 
However, to avoid pilferage of electricity, certain electricity 
boards insist that the service connections should first be 
connected to the energy meter, thento the! C cutout and 
then to the consumer main switch.   In all the cases the 
neutral should be directly connected from the outgoing 
terminals of the   energy   meter to the consumer main 
switch. (Fig 4b) 
Precautions while installing energy meters 
«   Energy meters which are tested and approved by the 
local electricity board authorities only should be used. 
«   Energy meters should be used in vertical positiononly. 
*   Connections for incoming and outgoing supply should 
be made according tothe manufacturer''s instructions/ 
connection diagram which will be available onthe inner 
side of the terminal plate of the energy meters. 
NE code of practice and IE rules for energy meter 
installation 
Energy meters shall be installed at such a place whichis 
readily accessible to both the owner ofthe buildingandthe 
authorised representatives of the supply authority. 
It should be installed at a height where   it is convenient to 
note the meter reading; itshould preferably be notinstalled 
below 1   m fromthe ground.   The energy meters should 
either be provided with a protective covering,   enclosing 
 them completely, except the glass window through which 
 the readings are noted or should be mounted inside a 
completely enclosed panel provided with hinged or sliding 
doors with arrangement for locking it. 
Any meter placed uponthe consumer''s premises shall be 
of appropriate capacity and shall be deemed to be correct 
if its limits of error do not exceed 3% above or below 
absolute accuracy at allloads inexcess of one tenth of full 
loads and up to full load. 
No meter shall register at no load. 
General instructions : The body of the energy meter 
should be earthed to the general mass of earth using a 
proper size of earth continuity conductor depending upon 
the current capacity of the installation. 
For multi-storeyed buildings which consist ofanumber of 
offices or commercial centres or flats occupying various 
areas, the electrical load for each of them is metered 
separately.   In   such   cases,   all   the   energy meters are

Electrician - Wiring   Installation and   Earthing 
 Estimation of load, cable size, bill of material and cost for a wiring installation 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson, you will be able to 
*   calculate the load(s) and select the number of sub(branch) circuits 
 *   estimate the load   in a circuit 
 *   select proper cable size for branch main circuits and the supply system 
*   estimate and list out the accessories for given wiring installation. 
Aminimumof   two lighting sub-circuits shall be providedin 
each house so that in case of fault in one sub-circuit, the 
whole house is not plunged in total darkness. 
The load on power circuits should be restricted to 3000 
watts having not more than two socket outlets. 
Estimation of load requirements 
Electrical installation in domestic dwellings is basically 
designed to cater to light and fan loads and for electrical 
appliances and gadgets. In estimating the current   to be 
carried by any branch circuit,   unless the actual values are 
known, these shall be calculated based on the following 
recommendedratings. 
Item   Recommended 
rating ( in watts) 
Incandescent lamps   60 
Ceiling fans   60 
Table fans   60 
6 A, 3-pin socket-outlet points   100 
Fluorescent tube   40 
Power socket outlets (16 A)   1000 
Example 
Estimate the cost of materialforwiring PVC channel foran 
office room having 2 lamps 1 fan one 6A socket outlet. 
To estimate the cost of   material the electrician has to 
follow these steps: 
Type of wiring to be decided- PVC channel (casing and 
capping - given). 
Position of the electrical points/Loads hasto be decidedas 
per the requirment. 
Layout of the office has to be prepared (Fig 1). 
Total load to be calculated, Inthe given example 
i   Tube2nosx40W   =   80W 
ii   Fanino x 60 VW   =   60W 
iii   SA socket 1 no   = 100 W 
 240 W 
 circuit/connection diagram forthe roomhaste be developed.

LAYOUT DIAGRAM OF AN OFFICE ROOM   g 
 Based on the layout and circuit diagram calculate the 
length of PVC channel required. 
1) Length of PVC channel 
 in Roof   =5+4+3=8m 
 2) Vertical drops   =0.540.542.0= 3.0m 
Total   =8+3.0   =11.0m 
3) Add 10% tolerance   =1.1m 
 12.1m 
 Calculate the length of wire and size of wire based on 
layout, circuit diagram and load. Inthe given example,the 
total load is   240W the current taken by the total load are 
 P   240 
 i=   = 
 VxCos@   2400.8  
=1.25A 
 Hence PVC copper flexible   1sqmm wire is enough to this 
circuit/room.   However since this wiring come inthe catagory 
of commercial wiring, for safe-side, we can choose 1.5sq 
mm PVC insulated copper flexible wire. 
Assume vertical drop is 0.5 m for tube lights and 2m for 
switch board then the length of wire required is 
 From Ato Band

 Estimation   for 3 phase domestic and   commercial wiring 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state specific rules related to 3-phase wiring installations 
*   estimate the wiring by load calculation, load distribution, layout diagram, wiring diagram, selection of 
cables, selection of conduit, calculation of conduit length, cable length, accessories required and the cost 
of wiring.

 Study the consumer’s requirement of light, fanand power 
points in each room (Fig 2). 
Required conduit length has to be calculated as per given 
method. 
NE code recommends the horizontal run of cables should 
be ata height of 2.5m (250cm) andthe height of switches 
fromfloor level should be   130cm. The example taken here 
for the roof height is 3m (800cm) from floor level.   In all 
cases the dimension of the rooms should be available for 
estimating. 
Vertical run: As suchall vertical runs can be calculated 
as under (Refer Fig 4) for L , phase. 
Length of selected conduit = 
Roof height - (down drop + switch height) x No. of 
vertical runs 
= 3m-(1.20m+1.30m) x No. of vertical heights 
(38m- 2.5m) x No. of vertical heights 
0.5m x No. of vertical heights (Eqn. 1) 
The value 0.5m will change   if there is difference in roof 
height and height of horizontal run of conduit changes.

 Length of conduit required for down drops 
This could be calculated as under: 
Length of selected conduit= Height of conduit in horizontal 
run - Switch   position   height x   No.   of down drops for 
 switches 
 Length of conduit required for roof runs 
This could be calculated as under 
Length of selected conduit = Sum   of   the actual length of 
roof run taken in each case. 
For each size the total requirement is to be calculated. 
Length of conduit required for horizontal run 
Length of selected conduit = sum of the actual length of 
horizontal run taken in each case. 
Length of conduit requiredforthe distance between main 
switch and DB is to be calculated.   In most of the cases 
wall is thickness has to be taken into account. 
Example :   (Refer the   layout and wiring diagram with 
respect to phase L.) In all cases except for main switch 
and   DB the   cable   used   is   1/1.12   copper   cable   and 
maximumnumber of cable it canaccommodate in 19mm 
conduit is 7 cables.   Hence PVC conduit of 19mm is 
chosen. 
1   Length of conduit required for vertical run 
Length for vertical run = 0.5m x No. of vertical height 
Acareful study of layout indicates there are 8 vertical 
height runs 
=   0.5mx8= 4mof 19mm PVC conduit 
2   Lengthofconduit required for down drops 
Length of down drops =   1.2m x No. of down drops

 The following tests shall be done: 
Insulation resistance between conductors and earth: 
For this test, put “OFF'' the main switch and remove the 
mainfuse-carrier. Alldistributionfuses should be “|IN'': the 
lamps should be in their holders and all switches for fans 
and lights should be in the “IN'' position.   Unplug all the 
appliances from the sockets,   and short the phase and 
neutral of the sockets with a jumper wire. 
Connect the phase and neutral cables at the outgoing 
terminals ofthe mainswitch together, and connectthe lead 
of the   Megger terminal   to the   shorted   cables.   (Fig   4) 
Connectthe other leadofthe Meggertothe earthconnection 
and rotate the Megger at its rated speed. 
The reading thus obtained should not be lower than the 
lowest of the values obtained in these three metheds.

between 
conductors and 
earth (or) between 
the phase and 
neutral 
a) Zero reading 
b) Higher reading 
in terms of kiloohms 
ormegohms 
a) Polarity was found 
wrong throughout 
the installation. 
b) Polarity found wrong 
 in one or two sockets. 
 a)   1 megohm or above 
b) Less than 1 megohm 
 a) Ok. 
 b) Operate each individual   switch inthe circuit. Where the 
reading jumps   te a higher value, there will be an open 
circuit, either by fused bulbs or loose connections at the 
terminals or break in the wire. 
After identifying the subcircuit, check the continuity of 
cables in the smaller zones till the defect is detected 
and rectified. 
Where 2-way switches are encountered, operate the 
switches one by one to detect the fault. 
a) Switch off the mains. Removethe fuse-carrier. Interchange 
the output terminals at ICDP switch or at DB. 
b) See that the phase is connected to the right side terminal 
of the socket. 
a) OK.   Check the value of the insulation resistance by the 
formula 
 50 
 Megohms =   \o.of outlets 
 For PVC wired installation replace 50 by 12.5. Incase the 
measured value of insulation resistance is equal to or 
more than the calculated value, the insulation is OK. 
b) Otherwise locate the fault by sectionalising the zone and 
replacing the defective cable with a good one. If, however, 
the values obtained are not sufficiently high, withdraw all 
the fuses ofthe distribution fuse-board and test again. 
This test will include only that portion of the installation 
between the main switch and the distribution fuse-boarad. 
lf the fault does not lie in this section, proceed to the dis-

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
* explain the reasons for system and equipment earthing 
® define the terminalogy related to earthing 
® state and explain the methods of preparing pipe earthing and plate earthing, according to B.I.S. 
 recommendations 
 ¢ explain the procedure for reducing the resistance of   earth electrodes to an acceptable value. 
Earthing 
Connecting the non-condutive metal   body/parts of an 
electrical equipment and systemtothe earth through alow 
resistance condutor is called as earthing. 
Earthing of an electrical installation can be brought under 
two major categories. 
*   System earthing 
*   Equipmentearthing 
System earthing: Earthingassociated with current-carrying 
conductors is normally essential to the security of the 
system, and Is generally known as system earthing. 
System   earthing   is   done   at   generating   stations   and 
substations. 
The purpose of system earthing is to: 
*   maintainthe ground atzero reference potential, thereby 
ensuring that the voltage on each live conductor is 
restricted to such a value with respect to the potential 
of the general mass ofthe earth asis consistent withthe 
level of the insulation applied 
*   protectthe system when any fault occurs againstwhich 
earthing is designed to give protection, by making the 
protective gear to operate and make the faulty portion 
of the plant harmless. 
Equipment earthing: Earthing of non-current carrying 
metalwork and conductor which is essential for the safety 
of human life, animals and property is generally known as 
equipment earthing. 
Terminology 
Earth-continuity conductor (ECC): Theconductor which 
connectthe non-conductive metal part/body of anelectrical 
system/equipment tothe earth electrode iscalledasearth 
contained conductor. 
Earth electrode:   A metal plate, pipe or other conductor 
electrically connected to the general mass of the earth. 
Earth fault:   Live portion of an electrical system getting 
accidentally connected to earth. 
Leakage current:   A   current of relatively small value, 
which passes through the insulation of conductive parts/ 
wire.

 Trainees   can   be   instructed   to   refer   the 
international electrotechnical commission (IEC 
60364-5-54) website for the standard safetyrules 
related with earthing installation for the further 
details. 
Dead:   Dead''   means   at or about earth   potential   and 
disconnected from any live system. 
Earth: Aconnection to the general mass of earth by means 
ofanearthelectrode. Anobjectis said to be “earthed'' when 
it is electrically connected to an earth electrode; and a 
conductor is said to be “solidly earthed! whenitis electrically 
connected to an earth electrode. 
Reasons for earthing: The basicreasonfor earthing isto 
prevent or minimize the riskof shockto human beings and 
livestock. The reason for having a properly earthed metal 
partinan electrical installationis   to provide alow resistance 
discharge path for earth leakage currents which would 
otherwise prove injurious or fatal to a person or animal 
touching the metal part

Let   us   consider   a   240V   AC   circuit   connected   to   an 
apparatus having a load resistance of 60 ohms. Assume 
thatthe defective insulation of cable makesthe metal body 
live and the metal body is not earthed. 
When a person,   whose body resistance is 1000 ohms, 
comes in contact with the metal body of the   apparatus 
whichis at 240V, aleakage current may pass through the 
body of the person (Fig 2).

 Thisleakage currentis   4. 8 times higherthanthe fuse rating, and, 
hence, the fuse will blow and disconnect the supply from the 
mains. The personwillnot geta shockduetotwo reasons. Before 
thefuse operates, the metal bocy andearthare inthe same zero 
potential, and across the person, there is no difference of 
potential.   Vvithin a short   (milli-seconds)   time the fuse 
blows to open the defective circuit,   provided the earth 
circuit resistance is sufficiently low. 
By studying the above two cases, itis clear thata properly 
earthed   metal   body   eliminates tne shock hazards to 
persons and also avoids fire hazards in the system by 
blowing the fuse quickly in case of ground faults. 
Types of earth electrodes 
Rodand pipe electrodes (Fig 4): These electrodes shall 
be made of metal red or pipe having a clean surface not 
covered   by   paint,   enamel   or other   poorly conducting 
material. 
Rod electrodes of steel or galvanised iron shall be at least 
16 mm in diameter, and those of copper shall be at least 
 12.5 mm in diameter.

 This current, as can be judged from Table 1,   is highly 
dangerous, and might prove to be fatal. Onthe other hand, 
the   Sampsfuse inthe circuitwill not blow for this additional 
leakage current of 240 milliamperes. As such the metal 
body will   have 240V supply and   may eléctrocute any 
person touching it. 
CASE 2:   Metal body of apparatus when earthed. 
Incase the metal body of the apparatus is earthed ( Fig 3), 
the   moment the metal body comes in contact with the live 
 wire, a higher amount of leakage current will flow through 
 the metal body to earth.

 Insulation   resistance tester (Megger) 
 Plate electrodes shall be buried such that the top edge is at 
a depth not less than 1.5 mfromthe surface of the ground. 
Where the resistance of one plate electrode is higher than 
the required value, two or more plates shall be used in 
parallel. In sucha case, the two plates shall be separated 
from each other by not less than 8.0 m. 
Plates shall preferably be set vertically. 
Plate electrodes is recommended in generating stations 
and substations. 
Ifnecessary, plate electrodes shallhave a galvanizediron 
water pipe buried vertically and adjacent to the electrode. 
One end of the pipe shall be atleast 5 cm above the surface 
of the ground, and it need not be more than 10 cm. The 
internal diameter ofthe pipe shall be atleast 5 cm and need 
not be more than 10 cm. The length of pipe, if   under the 
earth''s surface, shall be such thatitshould be able toreach 
the centre ofthe plate. Innocase, however, shall itbe more 
than the depth of the bottom edge of   the plate. 
Methods   of   reducing   the   resistance   of   an   earth 
electrode to an acceptable value: 
The earth electrode resistance is found higher in rocky or 
sandy areas where moisture is very low. 
The following methods are suggested to bring down the 
earth electrode resistance to an acceptable value. 
1   Afterinstallingthe rodor pipe or plate inearth, the earth 
pit   (the area surrounding the rod / pipe / plate) should 
be treated with layers of coke and commen salt to get 
a lower   value of earth resistance. 
2   Pouring water in the earth pit at repeated intervals 
lowers the earth electrode resistance. 
3   Connecting a number of earth electrodes in parallel 
reduces the earth electrode resistance. 
4   Soldering the earth connections or using non-ferrous 
clamps lowers the earth electrode resistance. 
5   Avoidingrustinthe earth electrode connections lowers 
the earth electrode resistance. 
Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
* state the working principle of an insulation tester (Megger) 
* explain the construction and working of megger 
* state the uses of an insulation tester like insulation test, continuity test etc. 
* state the safety precautions to be observed while using an insulation tester. 
Megger 
Itis an electrical measuring instrument generally used 
to measure the insulation resistance of an installation/ 
equipment etc in terms of Megaohms. 
Necessity of megohmmeter 
Ordinary ohmmeters   and   resistance   bridges   are   not 
generally designed to measure extremely high values of 
resistance. The   instrument designed for this purpose is

Construction 
 The megonmmeter consists of (1) a small DC generator, 
(2) a meter calibrated to measure high resistance, and (3) 
a cranking system. (Fig 2)

GENERATOR 
 ELNZSez2 
 A generator commonly called a magneto is often designed 
to produce various voltages. The output may be as low as 
500 volts or as high as 1 megavolt. The current supplied 
by the megahmmeter is in the order of 5 to 10 milliamperes. 
The   meter scale   is   calibrated:   kilo-chms   (K ©)   and 
 megohms(MQ). 
 Working   principle 
The   permanent   magnets supply the flux for both the 
generator and the metering device. The voltage coils are 
connected in series across the generator terminals. The 
current coil is arranged so that it will be in series with the 
resistance to be measured. The unknown resistance is 
connected between the terminals L and E. 
When the armature of the magnet is rotated, an emf is 
produced. This causes the current to flow through the 
current coil   and the   resistance being   measured.   The 
amount of current   is determined   by the value of the 
resistance and the output voltage of the generator. 
The torque exerted on the meter movement is proportional 
to the value of current flowing through the current coil. 
The current through the current coil, which is under the 
influence of the permanent magnet, develops a clockwise 
torque. The flux produced by the voltage coils reacts with 
the main field flux, and the voltage coils develop a counter- 
clockwise torque. 
Fora given armature speed, the current through the voltage 
coils is constant, andthe strength of the current coil varies 
inversely with the value of resistance being measured. As 
the voltage coils rotate counter-clockwise, they move away 
from the iron core and produce less torque. 
A point is reached for each value of resistance at which 
the torques of the current and voltage coils   balance, 
providing an accurate measurement of the resistance. 
Since the instrument does not have a controlling torque to 
 bring the pointer to zero, when the meter is notin use, the 
 position of the pointer may be anywhere on the scale. 
The speed at which the armature rotates does not affect 
the accuracy of the meter, because the current through 
both the circuits changes to the same extent for a given 
change in voltage. However, it is recommended to rotate 
the handle   at   the   slip speed   to obtain steady voltage. 
Because megohmmeters are designed to measure very 
high values of resistance, they are frequently used for 
insulation tests. 
 Connection for measurement 
 Vvhen conducting insulation resistance test between line 
and earth, the terminal ‘E’ of the insulation tester should 
be connected to the earth conductor. 
Precautions 
*   Amegohmmeter should not be used on alive system. 
*   Thehandle ofthe   megohmmeter should be rotated only 
ina clockwise direction or as specified.. 
 «   Rotate the handle at slip speed. 
 Uses   of   a megohmmeter 
*   Checking the insulation resistance 
«   Checking the continuity. 
Specification of Megger - 
Nowadays electronically operated, Meggers are available, 
called as push button type for general application and for 
industrial application motorised megger are also available. 
Hence a megger is basically specified based on the voltage

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
* state the precautions to be followed while selecting a site for the earth electrode 
 ¢ define earth resistance tester 
 * explain the principle constructon and working of an earth resistance tester 
* explain the method of measuring the earth resistance 
* state the IE rules pertaining to earthing. 
Precautions to be followed while selecting the site 
for earth electrode: However, even the earth electrode, 
either rod or plate type, implanted properly in the earth 
according to the specified recommendations   is found to 
have high resistance resulting in failure of safety. The earth 
electrode resistance could be kept at a reasonable level. 
Necessity of measuring of earth electrode resistance: 
The only way to ensure the acceptable value of earth 
electrode resistance is to measure the resistance with the 
use of an earth resistance tester. 
Earth   resistance tester:   It is an electrical   measuring 
instrument used to measure the resistance between any 
two points of the earth. It is also called as earth tester. 
Principle: The earth tester works onthe principle of the fall 
of potential method. 
In this method the two auxiliary electrodes B and C are 
placed at a straight line (Fig 1). 
 Fig 1 
 6331 
 FALL OF POTENTIAL METHOD ELN23 
 Analternating currentof I... magnitude is passed through 
the electrode A to the electrode C via the earth and the 
potential across electrodes A and B is measured. 
The resistance of electrodes BandC does notinfluence the 
 measurement result. 
 This is achieved by placing the electrode C   at a sufficient 
distance from A so that the resistance areas of Aand C 
are quite independent. A distance of above 15 metres 
between   electrode A and C   is regarded as sufficient 
distance. 
Construction and working of earth tester : The earth 
tester essentially consists of a hand drive generator which 
supplies the testing currentanda direct reading ohmmeter 
 (Fig 2). 
 The ohmmeter section of this instrument consists of two 
coils (potential and current coils) kept at 90° to each other 
and mounted on the same spindle. The pointer is attached 
tothe spindle. The current coil carries a current proportional 
to the current in the test circuit whereas the potential coil 
carries a current proportional to the potential across the 
resistance under test.

 Thus the current coil ofthe instrument acts as anammeter 
inthe fall of potential method andthe pressure coilacts as 
the voltmeter. Since the deflection of the onmmeter needle 
is proportionalto the ratio of the currentin the two coils, the 
meter gives resistance readings directly. 
When DC is used in electrode resistance measurement 
 the effectof electrolyticemf interferes with the measurement 
 andthe reading may go wrong. Toavoidthis, the supply to 
the electrodes should be AC. 
To facilitate this   the DC produced by the the hand generator 
is changed to AC through a current reverser.   After the 
alternating current passes through the electrodes, the 
measurement should   be done by an ohmmeter which 
requires DC supply. 
Tochangethe alternating voltage drop outside the instrument 
to direct voltage drop inside, a synchronous rotary rectifier 
is used (Fig 2) 
Sometimes the meter needle vibrates during measurement 
due to the fact that strong alternating currents of the same 
frequency   as   the   generated   frequency   enters the 
measuring circuit. 
In such cases the handle rotating speed of the instrument 
may be either increased or decreased. In general these

the   earth   electrode   resistance,   the   earth   electrode   is 
preferably disconnected from the installation. Then two 
spikes (the current and pressure spikes) are to be driven 
into the ground ata   straight line at a distance of 25 metres 
and 12.5   metres respectively from the main electrode 
under test. The pressure and current spikes andthe main 
electrode need to be connected to the instrument ( Fig 1} 
The earth tester has to be placed horizontally andis rotated 
at a rated speed (normally 160 r.p.m.). The resistance of 
the electrode under test is directly read on the calibrated 
dial.   To ensure correct measurement,   the   spikes are 
placed at a different position around the electrode under 
test, keeping the distance the same as inthe first reading. 
The average of these readings isthe earthresistance ofthe 
electrode. 
.E. Rules pertaining to earthing 
Earthing shall generally be carried out in accordance with 
the   requirements of   Indian   Electricity Rules   1956,   as 
amended fromtime totime, andthe relevant regulations of 
the electricity supply authority concerned. The following 
Indian Electricity Rules are particularly applicable to both 
systemand equipmentearthing: 32,51 ,61,62,67,69 88(2) 
and 90. 
Extracts from Indian Electricity Rules,   1956 
Rule no. 32:   Identification   of   earthed   and   earthed 
neutral   conductors   and   position   of 
switches and cut-outs therein. 
Where the conductors include an earthed conductor ofa 
two-wire systemor an earthed neutral conductor ofa multi- 
wire system or a conductor which   is to   be connected 
thereto, the following conditions shall be compiled with. 
1   Anindication of a permanent nature shall be provided by 
the owner of the earthed or earthed neutral conductor, 
or the conductor which is to be connected thereto, to 
enable such a conductor to be distinguished from any 
live conductor. Such indication shall be provided: 
a   where the earthed or earthed neutral conductor is 
the property of the supplier, at or near the point of 
commencement of supply 
b   where a conductor forming part of a consumer''s 
system isto be connected tothe supplier''s earthed 
or earthed neutral conductor at the point   where 
such connection is to be made. 
2   No cut-out, link or switch other than a linked-switch 
arranged to operate simultaneously on the earthed or 
earthed neutral conductor and   live conductors shall be 
inserted or remain inserted in any earthed or earthed 
neutral conductor of atwo-wire system or inany earthed 
or earthed neutral conductor of a multi-wire system or 
in any conductor connected thereto with the following 
exceptions: 
a   alink for testing purposes or 
b   aswitchforuse in controlling a generator or trans 
former. 
Ruleno.51:   Provisions applicable to medium, high 
or extra high voltage installations 
All metal work enclosing, supporting or associated withthe 
installation, otherthanthatcesignedto serve asta conductor, 
shall,   if   considered   necessary   by   the   Inspector,   be 
connected with earth. 
 Rule no.61: Connection with earth 
 1   The following provisions shall apply to the connection 
with earthofsystems at low voltage in cases where the 
voltage between phases or outers normally exceeds 
125 volts and of systems at medium voltage. 
a   The neutral conductor of a three-phase four-wire 
system, and the middle conductor of a two-phase 
three-wire system shall be earthed by notless than 
two separate and distinct connections with earth 
both atthe generating station and atthe substation. 
 It may also be earthed at one or more points along 
 the distribution system or service line in addition to 
any connection with earth which   may be at the 
consumer''s premises. 
b   Inthe case of a system comprising electric sypply 
lines having concentric cables, the external conductor 
of suchcables shall be earthed by two separate and 
distinct connections with earth. 
c¢   The connection with earth may include a link by 
means of which the connection may be temporarily 
interrupted for the purpose of testing or for locating 
a fault. 
d   Inthe case of analternating current system, there 
shall not be inserted inthe connection with earth any 
impedance (other than that required solely for the 
operation of switchgear or instrumets), cut-out or 
circuit-breaker,   and the result of a test made to 
ascertainwhetherthe current (ifany) passingthrough 
the connection with earth is normal, shall be duly 
recorded by the supplier. 
e   Noperson shall make connection with earth by the 
aid of, nor shall keep it in contact with, any water 
main not belonging to him except with the consent 
of the owner thereof and of the inspector. 
f   Alternating current systems which are connected 
with   earth   as   aforesaid   may   be   electrically 
interconnected. Providedthat eachconnection with 
earthis bonded to the metal sheathing and metallic 
armouring   (if   any)   of   the   electric   supply   lines 
concerned.

 Illumination   terms   -   Laws 
 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
*   state and explain different terms used in illumination 
*   state properties and advantages of good illumination 
*   state and explain laws of illumination. 
 Definitions 
 A few principle terms in connection with illumination are 
defined below. 
Luminous flux (F or F): The flux of light emitted froma 
luminous body is the energy radiated per second in the 
form oflightwaves. The unit of luminous   flux is “lumen''(lm). 
Luminous intensity(I}: The luminous intensity of a light 
source ina given direction isthe luminous flux givenout by 
the light source per unit solid angle. The angle subtended 
by an area r on the surface of sphere of radius   r, at the 
centre   of sphere   is unit solid angle.   In SI,   the   unit of 
luminous intensity is the candela. 
Candela: This is the amount of light emitted in a given 
direction by a source of one candle power. SI base unitis 
candela (cd).   1 candela = 0.982 international candles. 
Lumen (Im): It is the unit of luminous flux. This is defined 
as the amount of light contained in one steradian froma 
source of one candela at its focus. (Fig 1) 
 \ 
 Ifthe shaded area =r? anda source of one candelais atthe 
centre C, the light contained within the solid angle is one 
lumen. 
 Fig 1 
 ELN248811 
 The light output of electric lamp is measuredin lumens and 
their luminous efficiency is expressed in lumens per watt 
(ImAw). 
luminance or Illumination (E): |lluminance of asurface 
is defined as the luminous flux reaching it perpendicularly 
per unit area. The metric unit is the lumen / m? or lux (Lx). 
Lux: This is the total output of light. Lumen per square 
meter (1m/m?) orluxis the intensity of illumination produced 
inthe inner surface of a hollow sphere of radius one meter 
by a standard candle atthe centre. Sometimes this is also 
knownas metre-candle. 
Lighting engineers use a pocket-size instrument calleda 
‘lightmeter'' to measure illuminance; and the reading inlux 
is read off the scale (Fig 2). 
Factors to be viewed for correct illumination: The 
following   are   the   important   factors   which   should   be 
considered while planning correct and a gocd   Illumination:

 Nature of work : Consideringthe nature of work, sufficient 
and suitable lighting sould be maintained. For example, a 
delicate work like racdioand TV assembling, etc. requires 
good illumination to increase the production of work where 
as for rough work like storage, garages, etc needs very 
small illumination. 
Design of Apartment : The design of apartment must be 
kept in view while planning scheme fer illumination.   It 
means that the light emitted by the illumination source 
should not strike the eyes of the occupants or workers. 
Cost:   Itis animportantfactor which should be considered 
while   designing   an   illumination   scheme   for   particular 
 purpose. 
 Maintenance   Factor   :   VVhile   planning   illumination,   it 
should also be kept in viewthe amount of reduction of light 
due to accumulation of dust or smoke onthe source of light 
 and after how much period cleanliness isrequired. VWWhere 
 there   is a   possibility of heavy loss of light due to the 
adherence of smoke, arrangement for the extra light is to 
be made fromthe very beginning. 
Properties of good illumination 
Anillumination source should, have the following properties. 
i   Itshould have sufficient light. 
ii   It should not strike the eyes. 
ili   It should not produce glareness in the eyes. 
WV   Itshould be installed atsuch   a place   thatit gives uniform 
 light. 
 v_   It should be of correct type as needed. 
 uM   Itshould have suitable shades and refelectors.

 Types of lamps 
 There are many   types   of electric lamps now available. They 
differ in construction and inthe principle of   operation. 
They give lightas a result of heating the filament toa very 
high temperature. The lamps can be grouped as follows. 
Electric lamps

Carbon   Metal 
 Filament lamp: A lamp in which a metal, carbon or other 
filament   is   rendered   incandescent   by the   passage of 
electric current. 
Vacuum lamp:   A filament lamp in which the filament 
operates ina vacuum. 
Gas-filled lamp: A   filament lamp in which the filament 
operates in an inert gas. 
Halogen lamp: A tungsten filament lamp in which the 
tungsten filament operates ina relatively small space filled 
with an inert gas and halogen of iodine or bromine. 
Arc lamp: An electric lamp in which the light is emitted by 
 an arc. 
 Discharge lamp: An eléctric lamp in which the light is 
obtainecby   a discharge of electricity betweentwo electrodes 
in gas or vapour. 
Tungsten filament lamp: This lamp consists essentially 
ofafine wire ofthe metal, tungsten (thefilament) supported 
 Direct and   indirect lighting 
 ina glass envelope and the air evacuated from the glass 
 bulb - hence called   a vacuum lamp.

Low voltage lamps - different wattage lamps in series 
 Objectives: Atthe end of this lesson you shall be able to 
* state the purpose of   differtent voltage lamps 
* calculate and compare the hot resistance of the s ame voltage but of different wattage/current lamps 
*   describe the method of measuring and calculating the   ‘hot resistance’ 
* state the effects of different wattage lamps in series. 
Purpose: In quite afew placeswe uselowvaltage supply 
 i.e.   BY   TZ or 24¥)   such   as in   automobile vehicles. 
 Automobile vehicles are equipped with many lights to 
provide an efficient lighting system for both day and night 
driving conditions. The various lights require the use of 
different wattage andtypes of light lamps to provide the 
amount of illumination desired. 
Glow conditions of low wattage lamps with current 
flow through   it: An   electric lamp   changes   electrical 
anergy into heat and light, when current flaws through its 
filament and   causes it to   become   incandescent.   The 
filamentis made oftungsten wire. The low voltage lamps 
are generally oflowwattage because ata low voltage the 
currenttaken bythe filamentfor a given wattage is much 
more as compared ta the domestic light. 
Different wattage lamps in series: If the two lamps of 
different wattage in parallelacrossin A. circuit, t should 
be   same voltage for proper operation.   But, if they are 
connected in series they should have the sare current 
rating s. 
Allithe bulbs in house are probably connected in parallel 
andthe ywilldraw the current itrequires, and allthelarnps 
will glow bright. 
ftwo lamps with unequal wattages and same voltage 
ratings   are connected in series they will divide up the 
av allable voltage between therm, 
Low wattage lamp will glow bright,   due to high 
resistance and highvoltage drop. High wattage 
lamp will glow dim, due to low resistance and 
low voltage drop.

 Objectives: At the end of this lesson you shall be able to 
* explain the construction and working of neon sign tubes 
* explain the colour mechanism of neon signs. 
Neon sign lamp 
Gas discharge lamp 
A gas discharge lamp is one in which some inert gas is 
filledina glass tube having two electrodes sealed intoeach 
end, which on heating allows the flow of electronthrough it. 
Toobtaina continuous flow of electron, gasis first charged 
but as the supply is disconnected from the bulb, the gasis 
discharged. Sucha lampis knownas electric Gas Discharge 
Lamp. Electric gas discharge lamps are of two maintypes: 
(i)   Cold cathode lamp 
(il)   Hot cathode lamp 
Cold CathodeLamps   (i) Neonlamp, (ii) neonsigntubes, 
(iii) sodium vapour lamp. 
Hot Cathode Lamps   (i) mercury vapour lamp (medium 
pressure), and (il) fluroscent tube (low pressure mercury 
vapourlamp) 
Types of gas discharge lamps 
Neon Lamp   This is a cold cathode lamp as shown in 
Fig 1   Neon gas at low pressure is used in it. 
 Fig 1 
 ELN248821 
 Construction 
 In this lamp, two flat or spiral electrodes are kept close 
together ina glass bulb so that the lamp can be operated 
at low voltage such as 150 V de or 110 V ac. On giving 
supply to the electrodes, the gas becomes ionised and 
emits light which is reddish in colour. In usual practice a 
2000W resistance is also connected in series with the 
electrodes which is placed in the cap of the lamp. This 
minimizes the fluctuation of current dueto   large variation of 
potential difference. 
 Uses 
 A neon lamp is generally used as an indicator lamp to 
indicate the presence of supply. It gives a small quantity of 
light and can also be used as a night lamp. A neon lamp 
of this type is also used inthe testing pencil which is of 0.5 
 Ww. 
 Neon sign tube 
Construction of neon sign tube: Neon sign tube lamps 
are used mostly for advertising purposes. Fig 2shows the 
construction details ofa neon signtube.   Aneonsigntube 
is mace of glass.

 The length ofthe tube varies from 1 metre to 5 metres, and 
the diameter varies from 10 mmto 20 mm. The tubes are 
joined with electrodes which are operated at high voltage. 
The electrodes are connected with nickel wires for more 
length or to different letters. (Fig 3) 
 Fig 3 
 ELN248823 
 The shape of the electrode is cylindrical. The electrodes are 
made of nickel, iron or copper.   The electrode consists of: 
*   aglass shell 
*   alead in wires 
*   aglass jacket seal 
*   aceramic collar. (heat resisting material) 
The electrodes are fitted at the end of the tubes and fused. 
Avacuumis created inthe tube before filling itup with an inert 
gas, suchas neonor helium. After that it willbe sealed. The
