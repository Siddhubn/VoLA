mm above the jaws ofthe bench vice. 
3   File the reference aide (surface 4)   indicatedin Fig 13 
withthe bastard file. 
4   Testthe fatness sith the blade ofthe Try square. 
Donottouc hthe surface of the job while filing. 
Use a vice clamp for protecting the finished 
 Sutaces 
 5   File the adjacent surface “B'' with a bastard file. 
6   Testthe fatnessandaleo check the ightangle withthe 
Try square. 
?   File the side ''l'' at   right angle to surfaces ‘4’, ''B''. 
6   Evenly apply   marking   media   (ump   chalk)   on the 
surfaces ‘4! and ''B''. 
9   Place surface ''B’ onthe levelling plate and scribe aline 
parallel ta ''B'' on surface 4 at adistance of 53 mm as 
shown in Fig 1.   Similarly on surface WA! mark a line 
parallel ta''B! ata distance ofS3imim.

Types of filing 
 Objective: This shall help you to 
*   file a flat surface. 
Filing method : The methodoffiling adopted depends on 
the type of surface profile to be filed, the type of surface 
texture required and the amount of materials to be re- 
moved. 
Diagonal filing: This type of filing is done when heavy 
reduction of material is required. The strokes are at an 
angle of 45°.   Because the stroke directions cross, the 
surface texture formed clearly indicates the high and low 
spots. Frequent checking of the level is not necessary, 
particularly, afterone has developeda steady movementof 
 the file. (Fig 1) 
 Fig 1 
 DIAGONAL FILING  ELN1216J1 
 Transverse filing: In this method the file strokes are at 
rightangles to the longerside of the work. This is commonly 
used to reduce material fromthe edges. Using this method, 
the size of the workpiece is brought close to the finishing 
size, and then final finishing Is done by longitudinal filing. 
 (Fig 2) 
Method of using   Centre Punch

 ELN1216J2  TRANSVERSE FILLING 
 Longitudinal filing: The file is moved parallel to the longer 
side of the work. Usually all surfaces are smooth—finished 
by this method. The filed surface texture will show uniform 
and parallel lines. (Fig 3)

 Objectives: This shall help you to 
 *   hold a centre punch over a scribed line 
 *   punch by dot/centre punch. 
Hold the punch ina relaxed manner between your thumb 
and   your fingers.   For centre/dot   punching,   place   the 
workpiece on a steel support plate. Place the punch in 
position.   Rest your hand onthe workpiece while doing so.

 The diameter of the jaw at the gripping point of 
the round nose pliers is little more than the 
terminal screw diameter.

 Turnthe firmly gripped nose pliersta form the required 
loop.   (Fig 3 
Finally set the loops withthe nose pliers as shown 
in Fig 4.

 Never make the hook long as the conductor 
may overlap. 
Keep the length of the exposed conductor to 
the minimum, net more than 3 mm, to prevent 
accidental contact with other wires.   (Fig 4)

11   Markthe length''L'' from the end of cable.   Length''L is 
equal to five times the diameter of the terminal screw.

 Mark the point where the insulation is to be skinned. 
Adjust the jaws of the manual stripper and set them to 
suit the cable conductor.

Do   not nick the conductor. For better practice 
try on a small waste piece.

 Partially cut insulation can be removed only 
with   more force.   Excessive force,   indicates 
improper cutting of insulation.

 Be careful while using the knife. 
Always cut keeping the object to be cut away from your

 Knives should not be used to remove insulation 
on very fine single or stranded conductors. 
 Knives should not be used to cut conductors. 
 Hand tools for skinning - manual wire stripper 
 Objectives: This shall help you to 
*   identify the parts of the manual wire stripper 
*   perform care and maintenance of manual wire stripper. 
 Hand operated wire stripping tools can be used to remove 
 P.V.C. orrubberinsulation from asingle core cable without 
damaging the conductor.   They are of two types manual 
and auto-eject. 
Manual wire stripper: The jaws have V shaped notches 
to cut the insulation. 
The adjuster screw allows to cut a wide range of wire 
diameters.   (Figs 1 and 2).

 Oftenone cutter becomes sharper than the other, andcuts 
 more than halfway through the wires, damaging the con- 
ductors.   In such an event, the blunt cutter should be 
sharpened.

 Thistoolhas a series of sharp openings   inits scissor blade 
to allow stripping of wire in gauge of different sizes or 
diameters. The gauge size of the wire must match withthe 
openinginthe wire stripperte prevent cutting into the wire 
and weakening it. 
 Precautions: 
 *   When using this tool, make sure that it is 
correctly adjusted before trying to strip the 
insulation from the cable so that it does not 
damage   the conductor.

 Hand tools for skinning - auto-eject stripper 
 Objectives: This shall help you to 
*   identify an auto-eject stripper 
*   take care while using an auto-eject stripper. 
Auto-eject strippers are used to cut the insulation from 
electrical wire without damaging the wire strands.   They 
remove the insulation automatically.   (Fig 1) 
This stripper has two sets of jaws:   one set grips the 
insulation while the other set has cutting edges. 
When the handles are apart, both sets of jaws are open.

 AUTO - STRIPPER  ELN132501 
ELN132502  This stripper operates automatically when the correct   JAWS CF AN AUTO STRIFFER 
 position onthe blade matching the diameter of conductor 
 in mm is selected,   and the   handles are compressed   Precautions:   While   using   this   stripper the 
 together.   cable insulation should be put in the proper 
slot to avoid damage to the conductor. 
In an auto-eject stripper, we can select different   blade 
 sizes to match different sizes of conductors. 
 Sub Exercise (S.Ex.) 1.2.18 - 1 
Prepare termination of cable lugs by using crimping tool 
 Objectives: At the end of this exercise you shall be able to 
*   skin the cable end 
*   select the pressure terminal (compression connector) that suits the size of the wire and that of the terminal 
select the pressure pliers that match the size of the pressure terminal 
*   use the crimping tool to crimp the lugs at the cable end. 
*   use an eyelet crimping plier for eyelet termination.

1   Collect the multistrand cable. 
2   Split the number of strands into two equal parts and 
twist them. (Fig 11a} 
3   Collect the eyelet. (Fig 11b) 
4   Fix   the   eyelet   by   placing   the   eyelet   between   the 
grouped strands close to the insulation and twist the 
free ends of the strands as shown in Fig 11c.

 The eyeletis then pressed on to the wire end by 
 the two formers of the eyelet closing pliers.

 TASK 3: Practice on twisting of single strand wires 
1   Take 300 mmof 1/1.5mm?aluminiumwire, or 1/1.2mm 
P.V.C copper   cable. 
Cut it into two pieces of 150 mm each. 
Remove the insulation of 50 mmin each piece by using 
stripper and clean it with cotton cloth. 
4   Cross the bare wires at 45° andata distance of 45 mm 
from the cable end. (Fig 13)

 5   Twist the ends tightly at least 6-8 twists. (Fig 14)

 While twisting   2 wires   together avoid   gaps 
between the twists. If it twisted with gap, it will 
trigger   sparks   and   overheat   as   shown   in 
 Fig 14. 
 5   Trim the excess length of the multi-strand wire after 
closing the eyelet using side-cutting pliers. 
6   Repeat the exercise with different sizes of eyelets for 
cable end termination. 
7   Get it checked by your instructor.

 Finish twisting the wires as shown in figure 15 & 16. 
Get it checked by your instructor. 
9   Grab both the copper ends with pliers. 
10 Rotate your wrist while using pressure on pliers.

 PROCEDURE 
 TASK 1:   Identify types of wires and cables 
The   instructor will   arrange   and   provide the 
various types of cable and wire pieces (assorted 
sizes) onthetableand   label themwith alphabets 
and explain themto trainees on, howto identify 
the types   of insulation,   conductors,   size of 
wires. Demonstrate howto measure the size of 
wires using SWG and micrometer. 
1   Take any one wire fromthe table, note downitsaplhabet 
in Table 1. 
2   Identify the type of insulation, type of conductor material 
and size of wires. Note it down in Table 1. 
3   Take at least five different types of wires and repeat 
 steps 1 and 2 Note down the details in Table 1. 
 4   Verify the specifications of the wires by referring with 
the data book. 
Take any one   cable from the table,   note down   its 
alphabet. 
Identify the type of cable (unarmoured and armoured 
cable) and note down in Table 1. 
Identify the type   of   insulation,   core   and   record   in 
Table 1. 
Verify the specifications of the cable by referring with 
the data book. 
Repeat steps 1 to 8for various wires and note the data 
in Table 1.
